This study aimed to evaluate the effect of SMS messaging on the self-care among pre-diabetic pregnant women. Methods: This randomized controlled trial conducted on 100 pre-diabetic pregnant women referred to Ahvaz Health Centers, Iran, Sep to Dec, 2016. Women were randomly assigned into the face to face education group and short message systems in addition to the face to face education group. Self-care variables were compared between the groups. Data was analyzed using chi-square, independent and paired t-tests. Results: There was no difference regard to FBG and OGTT, but there was a significant difference between groups in physical activity level ( P < 0.001) and in all food groups except bread and cereals after the intervention ( P < 0.05). Conclusion: The education through a short text message system seem couldn’t control the blood sugar, but it could promote physical activity and food additives of pre-diabetic pregnant women.

"Abdelaziz, Heba Ahmed; Dean, Yomna E.; Elshafie, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed",Effect of three modalities on emergence agitation among post-traumatic stress disorder patients undergoing laparoscopy: A randomized controlled study,"Background and aim: Emergence agitation (EA) after general anesthesia is common in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Due to the recent worldwide events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and wars, PTSD is not rare. Accordingly, a reliable, cost-effective anesthetic protocol to lower the incidence of EA is crucial. Therefore, we aimed to compare three different interventions for avoiding EA in PTSD patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Participants were divided into four groups: 1: performing pre-operative relaxation techniques (deep breathing exercise and progressive muscle relaxation [PMR]); 2: administrating intra-operative Ketamine; 3: applying both previously mentioned strategies and 4 as controls. Methods: This study was carried out on 144 adult women scheduled for gynecological laparoscopy, randomly allocated into four groups: three intervention groups and a control group (36 each). Women aged 18-45 years old, with a diagnosis of PTSD were included in the study. Patients with a positive history of major neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, or renal disease were excluded. Any patient who reported the use of psychiatric drugs were also excluded from the study. Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics software version 26. Kolmogorov- Smirnov was used to verify the normality of the distribution of variables. Odds ratio was calculated to clarify the strength and direction of the association between intervention groups and control. Data was deemed significant at a p-value ≤0.05. Results: Heart rate (HR) and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP) intra-operative and post-operative till 24 hours were significantly lower in groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to group 4 ( p<0.001). There was a significant statistical difference in the intraoperative HR percentage decrease. MABP percentage decrease post-operative was higher in all the intervention groups with no statistically significant difference, except for group 1 compared to group 4, which was statistically significant (12.28 ± 11.77 and 6.10 ± 7.24, p=0.025). Visual Analogue Scale measurements were significantly less in the intervention groups 1, 2, and 3 compared to group 4. On Riker sedation–agitation scores, group 1 was 85 times more likely to be non-agitated (85 (15.938 – 453.307), p<0.001), group 2 was 175 times more likely to be non-agitated (175 (19.932–1536.448), p<0.001) and group 3 was protected against agitation. Conclusion: Pre-operative relaxation techniques (breathing exercises and PMR) significantly lowered HR, MABP, VAS score, and EA than controls. These effects were not significantly different from intra-operative ketamine injection or the combination of both (relaxation techniques and ketamine). We recommend routine pre-operative screening for PTSD and the application of relaxation techniques (breathing exercises and PMR) in the pre-operative preparation protocol of PTSD-positive cases as well as routine practical application of preoperative relaxation techniques. Further studies on using pre-operative relaxation techniques in general could be cost-effective.

"Aboody, Dinur; Siev, Jedidiah; Doron, Guy",Building resilience to body image triggers using brief cognitive training on a mobile application: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Body image disturbance (BID) is common among women, characterized by persistent and distressing appearance dissatisfaction, and linked with eating disorders. Although effective, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered by trained professionals is not easily accessible. This randomized trial evaluated the effects of a CBT-based mobile application designed to increase resilience to body image triggers and reduce BID symptoms. Method: A non-clinical sample of women ( N = 90; M age = 23.52) was randomized to use the mobile application for approximately 4 min of daily exercises for two weeks or to a control condition. Body image was measured at baseline, immediately after two weeks of mobile application use, and at 1-month follow-up. To examine whether using the application was associated with increased resilience to common BID triggers, participants completed an Instagram exposure resilience task upon completion and at 1-month follow-up. Results: Relative to those in the control condition, participants who used the application demonstrated increased resiliency and reduced BID symptoms. Theses effects were medium-to-large and were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Conclusion: These results underscore the potential usefulness of brief, low-intensity, portable interventions in reducing BID symptoms and in increasing resilience to thin-ideal body messages often portrayed on social media.

"Abrantes, Ana M.; Van Noppen, Donnell; Bailey, Genie; Uebelacker, Lisa A.; Buman, Matthew; Stein, Michael D.",A feasibility study of a peer-facilitated physical activity intervention in methadone maintenance,"Purpose: While methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) has been effective in improving opioid use outcomes, most patients continue to engage in unhealthy lifestyles that lead to significant mental and physical health consequences. Interventions targeting increases in physical activity (PA) in MMT patients could have a significant impact on reducing the overall morbidity in these individuals. The purpose of this study was to assess acceptability and feasibility of a 12-week peer-facilitated PA intervention for MMT patients called TREC (Transforming Recovery with Exercise and Community). Method: We developed and then pilot-tested TREC in 26 low-active MMT clients (73% female; mean age = 41.2 years). TREC included: 1) an orientation session and intervention materials, 2) weekly PA discussion groups led by trained MMT clients, 3) peer-led walking groups and 4) a Fitbit activity tracker to facilitate self-monitoring of PA. Results: Participants attended 63% of eligible TREC sessions. Sixty-nine percent of the sample wore the Fitbit for at least 6 weeks (of the 12-week intervention). Participants reported that they enjoyed the group walks and that it was helpful to have a peer-facilitated PA group. There were small-to-moderate effect sizes for increases in PA, positive affect, and benefits of PA, and decreases in illicit opioid use and barriers to PA. No changes in depression, anxiety, and negative affect were observed from baseline to the end of the 12-week intervention. Conclusion: Indicators of feasibility and acceptability suggest that a peer-facilitated PA intervention can be incorporated in the context of MMT. Low active, opioid dependent clients showed increases in PA during the 12-week intervention. A future randomized clinical trial is necessary to determine the efficacy of TREC on long-term maintenance of PA and ancillary mental health and substance use outcomes.

"Achterkamp, R.; Hermens, H. J.; Vollenbroek-Hutten, M. M. R.",The influence of success experience on self-efficacy when providing feedback through technology,"Background: as a high level of self-efficacy is associated with bigger behavioral changes as well as to higher levels of physical activity, the development and implementation of strategies that successfully improve self-efficacy are important to technological interventions. We performed an experiment to investigate whether self-efficacy regarding a specific task can be influenced by using feedback strategies that focus on success experience and are provided through technology. Method: subjects were asked to walk from A to B in exactly 14, 16 or 18s, wearing scuba fins and a blindfold. The task guaranteed an equal level of task experience among all subjects at the start of the experiment and makes it difficult for subjects to estimate their performance accurately. This allowed us to manipulate feedback and success experience through technology-supported feedback. Results: subjects’ self-efficacy regarding the task decreases when experiencing little success and that self-efficacy regarding the task increases when experiencing success. This effect did not transfer to level of self-efficacy regarding physical activity in general. Graphical inspection of the data shows a trend towards a positive effect of success experience on task performance. Conclusion: experiencing success is a promising strategy to use in technology-supported interventions that aim at changing behavior, like mobile physical activity applications.

"Achterkamp, R.; Hermens, H. J.; Vollenbroek-Hutten, M. M. R.",The influence of vicarious experience provided through mobile technology on self-efficacy when learning new tasks,"Background: A high level of self-efficacy is a major contributor to the effectiveness of physical activity interventions. However, it is insufficiently known whether techniques that are used to influence self-efficacy in face-to-face or printed text interventions can also be successfully incorporated in modern-day, mobile technology-supported interventions. We performed an experiment to investigate whether self-efficacy regarding a specific task can be influenced through vicarious experience provided through mobile technology. Method: 36 subjects were asked to walk from A to B in exactly 14, 16, or 18 s, wearing scuba fins and a blindfold. The task guaranteed equal level of task experience at the start of the experiment. Before every trial, subjects in group 1 viewed a video on a smartphone of a subject successfully performing the task, subjects in group 2 did not view a video. Results and conclusion: Although subjects found the video helpful for successful performance of the task and reported high perceived similarity, subjects’ level of self-efficacy regarding the task, as well as task performance did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, a secondary outcome parameter did indicate a possible difference between how subjects walked forward while wearing the scuba fins (either shuffling forward, or raising their knees high up). Future studies should investigate whether such instructional videos can contribute to higher levels of self-efficacy in mobile, technology-supported interventions in more ecologically valid settings.

Design: A randomized control trial with participants ( N = 500) randomized to one of six intervention conditions in a 3 (risk communication format: bulleted list, table, risk ladder) x 2 (mental imagery behaviour: physical activity, active control [sleep hygiene]) factorial design. Methods: After receiving personalized risk estimates via a website on a smartphone, participants listened to an audiorecording that guided them through a mental imagery activity related to improving physical activity (intervention group) or sleep hygiene behaviour (active control). Participants received text message reminders to complete the imagery for 3 weeks post‐intervention, 4 weekly text surveys to assess behaviour and its cognitive and affective precursors, and a mailed survey 90 days post‐baseline. Results: Physical activity increased over 90 days by 19.5 more minutes per week (95%CI: 2.0, 37.1) in the physical activity than the active control condition. This effect was driven by participants in the risk ladder condition, who exercised 54.8 more minutes (95%CI 15.6, 94.0) in the physical activity condition than participants in the active control sleep hygiene group. Goal planning positively predicted physical activity behaviour (b = 12.2 minutes per week, p = 0.002), but self‐efficacy, image clarity, and affective attitudes towards behaviours did not ( p > 0.05). Conclusions: Mental imagery‐based self‐regulation interventions can increase physical activity behaviour, particularly when supported by personalized disease risk information presented in an easy‐to‐understand format.

This trial tested the independent and joint effects of a mobile health system automating adaptive goal setting and immediate financial reinforcement for increasing daily walking among insufficiently active adults. Study Design: Participants were randomized into a 2 (adaptive versus static goal setting) X 2 (immediate versus delayed financial incentive timing) condition factorial trial to increase walking. Settings/Participants: Participants (N = 512 adults) were recruited between 2016 and 2018 and were 64.5% female, aged 18–60 years, 18.8% Hispanic, 6.1% African American, and 83% White. Intervention: Principles of reinforcement and behavioral economics directed intervention design. Main Outcome Measures: Participants wore accelerometers daily (133,876 day-level observations) that remotely measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity bout minutes of ≥ 3 minutes/day for 1 year. Primary outcomes were between-condition differences in (1) engaging ≥ 1 bout of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on each day and (2) on days with ≥ 1 bout, daily total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes. Results: Mixed-effects hurdle models tested treatment group X phase (time) interactions using an intent-to-treat approach in 2021. Engaging in any ambulatory moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was greater for Adaptive than for Static Goal groups (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = 2.10, 2.60 vs OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.50, 1.84; p < 0.001) and for Immediate than for Static Reinforcement groups (OR = 2.16 95% CI = 1.94, 2.40 vs OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.59, 1.97; p < 0.01). The Immediate Reinforcement group increased by 16.54 moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes/day, whereas the Delayed Reinforcement group increased by 9.91 minutes/day ( p < 0.001). The combined Adaptive Goals + Immediate Reinforcement group increased by 16.52 moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes/day, significantly more than that of either Delayed Reinforcement group. Conclusions: This study offers automated and scalable–behavior change strategies for increasing walking among adults most at-risk for chronic diseases attributed to sedentary lifestyles.

"Adams, Zachary W.; Sieverdes, John C.; Brunner-Jackson, Brenda; Mueller, Martina; Chandler, Jessica; Diaz, Vanessa; Patel, Sachin; Sox, Luke R.; Wilder, Spencer; Treiber, Frank A.",Meditation smartphone application effects on prehypertensive adults’ blood pressure: Dose-response feasibility trial,"Objective: Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common chronic disease in the United States and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise, stress management) to reduce blood pressure (BP) are often complex with varying effectiveness. Breathing awareness meditation (BAM) is a stress management strategy with encouraging effects on BP, though widespread dissemination is hampered by the lack of an easy-to-use methodology to train and monitor BAM practices. A smartphone application (Tension Tamer [TT]) that implements BAM and tracks adherence has shown promise in addressing these gaps. This 6-month dose-response feasibility trial evaluated effects of the app on BP to further optimize BAM user guidelines. Methods: Sixty-four adults with prehypertension were randomized to complete TT-guided BAM sessions for 5-, 10-, or 15-min intervals twice daily over 6 months. Continuous heart rate readings derived from the phone’s video camera via reflective photoplethysmography were used as feedback and as an index of time-stamped adherence. Outcomes (resting BP, HR) were collected at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months. Results: Mixed modeling results showed a significant time effect for systolic BP (SBP) with a dose-response effect at Months 3 and 6. Adherence declined over time and was lowest in the 15-min dose condition, though SBP reductions were maintained. Generally, adherence was negatively associated with dose as the study progressed. Conclusions: Smartphone-implemented BAM appears to reduce SBP and can be a low-cost method to reach large populations.

"Adenekan, Modupe",Development and evaluation of a nurse practitioner-directed exercise program via a mobile application for adults with depression in a mental health practice,"Depression is a common mental health condition affecting millions of American adults. There have been many proposed interventions for managing depression, including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. However, evidence shows the benefit of nonpharmacological interventions, like exercise, in managing depression. Exercise is a cost-effective intervention with minimal negative impact, and side effects can be used alone or as an adjunct to other treatment options. The project aimed to answer the question - In adult patients diagnosed with depression, how does the implementation of an exercise intervention using a mobile application reminder when compared to current practice reduce depression symptoms over three months? At the end of the project, there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms for the 30 participants. Additionally, engagement of physical activity as measured by a valid and reliable tool also increased. The results showed promise for greater use of exercise interventions in clinical practice, and advanced nursing practitioners are leaders who can champion translation of this evidence into practice and policy changes.

We sought to determine whether the interventions delayed the occurrence of any acute event necessitating hospitalization. Methods: Electronic medical records (EMR) were obtained for 376 adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) self-management programs. All study participants had uncontrolled diabetes and were randomized into either: personal digital assistant (PDA), Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP), combined PDA and CDSMP (COM), or usual care (UC) groups. Subjects were followed for a maximum of two years. Time-to-hospitalization was measured as the interval between study enrollment and the occurrence of a diabetes-related hospitalization. Results: Subjects enrolled in the CDSMP-only arm had significantly prolonged time-to-hospitalization (Hazard ratio: 0.10; p = 0.002) when compared to subjects in the control arm. Subjects in the PDA-only and combined PDA and CDSMP arms showed no improvements in comparison to the control arm. Conclusion: CDSMP can be effective in delaying time-to-hospitalization among patients with T2DM. Practice implications: Reducing unnecessary healthcare utilization, particularly inpatient hospitalization is a key strategy to improving the quality of health care and lowering associated health care costs. The CDSMP offers the potential to reduce time-to-hospitalization among T2DM patients.

"Adjerid, Idris; Loewenstein, George; Purta, Rachael; Striegel, Aaron",Gain-loss incentives and physical activity: The role of choice and wearable health tools,"Economic incentives are a promising approach for improving health behavior but have been limited by their short-lived benefits. In this manuscript, we examine whether coupling economic incentives with motivational tools provided by health wearables can address this limitation and drive longer-term changes in health behavior. We focus on “gain-loss” incentive schemes that offer both an economic reward for goal attainment and a penalty for failure to meet a goal. In an experiment conducted on individuals wearing Fit- bit wearables, we find that gain-loss incentives can drive increases in physical activity but are limited by the element of choice. Specifically, we find modest and short-lived increases in physical activity for those provided the choice of gain-loss incentives. The subpar benefits for this group seem to emerge because those who benefit most from these schemes do not opt into them when they are voluntary. In contrast, we find significant and persistent increases in physical activity for those assigned (oftentimes against their preference) to the same gain-loss incentives. These individuals recorded ~2,000 additional steps daily during the incentive period, and benefits persisted for six months after incentives ended. Critically, the persistent gains to this group were driven by individuals who also utilized the wear- able’s goal-setting tool. Our results suggest that a novel approach toward motivating sustained changes in health behavior couples aggressive incentive schemes that jolt individuals out of their comfort zone in the short term with motivational tools built into health wearables that help individuals sustain healthy behavior after economic incentives end.

"Agboola, Stephen; Jethwani, Kamal; Lopez, Lenny; Searl, Meghan; O'Keefe, Sandra; Kvedar, Joseph",Text to move: A randomized controlled trial of a text-messaging program to improve physical activity behaviors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Background: Text messages are increasingly being used because of the low cost and the ubiquitous nature of mobile phones to engage patients in self-care behaviors. Self-care is particularly important in achieving treatment outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Objective: This study examined the effect of personalized text messages on physical activity, as measured by a pedometer, and clinical outcomes in a diverse population of patients with T2DM. Methods: Text to Move (TTM) incorporates physical activity monitoring and coaching to provide automated and personalized text messages to help patients with T2DM achieve their physical activity goals. A total of 126 English- or Spanish-speaking patients with glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) >7 were enrolled in-person to participate in the study for 6 months and were randomized into either the intervention arm that received the full complement of the intervention or a control arm that received only pedometers. The primary outcome was change in physical activity. We also assessed the effect of the intervention on HbA 1c, weight, and participant engagement. Results: All participants (intervention: n = 64; control: n = 62) were included in the analyses. The intervention group had significantly higher monthly step counts in the third (risk ratio [RR] 4.89, 95% CI 1.20 to 19.92, P = .03) and fourth (RR 6.88, 95% CI 1.21 to 39.00, P = .03) months of the study compared to the control group. However, over the 6-month follow-up period, monthly step counts did not differ statistically by group (intervention group: 9092 steps; control group: 3722 steps; RR 2.44, 95% CI 0.68 to 8.74, P = .17). HbA 1c decreased by 0.07% (95% CI –0.47 to 0.34, P = .75) in the TTM group compared to the control group. Within groups, HbA 1c decreased significantly from baseline in the TTM group by –0.43% (95% CI –0.75 to –0.12, P = .01), but nonsignificantly in the control group by –0.21% (95% CI –0.49 to 0.06, P = .13). Similar changes were observed for other secondary outcomes. Conclusion: Personalized text messaging can be used to improve outcomes in patients with T2DM by employing optimal patient engagement measures.

This trial aimed to determine the effect of footbath on sleep disturbance in postmenopausal women. One hundred menopausal women were randomly stratified using a permuted block randomization procedure by Random Allocation Software, and assigned to one of two study groups: control (without intervention, n = 50) and intervention (footbath, n = 50). The footbath group was asked to lie their feet into the warm water for 20 min in a container with a depth of 10 cm one hour before the usual sleeping time for 6 weeks. To assess sleep quality, we used the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). To evaluate severity of menopause symptoms, the Greene scale was applied. Before the intervention, 96% of the subjects in the footbath group and 94% in the control group were poor sleepers. The results of analysis of covariance showed significant improvement in sleep quality and decrease in severity of menopause signs in the footbath group compared to the control group. At the baseline, there was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of menopause signs and the global score of PSQI in all study individuals (p ≤ .001, r = .464). The present study findings showed that footbath intervention enhanced sleep quality in menopausal women. Thus, footbath as a safe, simple, and non‐pharmacological application can improve quality of life in postmenopausal women and inhibit problems due to inadequate sleep quality.

"Ahmed, Mavra; Oh, Angela; Vanderlee, Lana; Franco-Arellano, Beatriz; Schermel, Alyssa; Lou, Wendy; L'Abbé, Mary R.",A randomized controlled trial examining consumers’ perceptions and opinions on using different versions of a FoodFlip© smartphone application for delivery of nutrition information,"Background: Food labelling is a common intervention to improve diets, where the back-of-pack Nutrition Information Panel (or Nutrition Facts table (NFt)) provides comprehensive nutrition information on food packages. However, many consumers find it difficult and time-consuming to identify healthier foods using the NFt. As a result, different interpretative nutrition rating systems (INRS) may enable healthier food choices and it is essential that consumers have the tools to allow for easily accessible nutrition information. The objective of this study was to examine consumers’ perceptions of different (INRS) for delivery of nutrition information using different versions of a smartphone app, FoodFlip©. Methods: This study was part of a larger randomized controlled trial examining consumer perceptions of different INRS on food products. A nationally representative commercial sample of 2008 Canadians were randomized to one of four INRS intervention groups: 1) traffic light, 2) health star rating, 3) ‘high-in’ warning labels or 4) no INRS (NFt only; control) and asked to scan or enter 20 products into FoodFlip© from a list of food products provided to them with varying levels of healthfulness. After completing the app task, participants were asked a series of 7-point Likert-scale and open-ended questions to provide opinions on the usability and functionality of the app. Results: Of the survey sample of 1997 participants, 95% ( n = 1907) completed the app task, with similar number of participants in each treatment group. The mean age was 40 ± 12 years with no differences in sociodemographic characteristics between treatment groups. The health star rating ranked significantly lower in comparison to the other treatment groups in terms of usefulness (OR, 95% CI -0.67, 0.52–0.85), believability (0.59, 0.46–0.75), and understanding (0.55, 0.44–0.71) ( p < 0.001). The health star rating (1.20, 0.94–1.53) and control (NFt) (1,1,1) ranked significantly lower than the traffic light or the ‘high-in’ warning labels for their ability to compare the healthfulness of products ( p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated Canadian consumers’ preference for a nutrient-specific system (i.e. traffic light or ‘high-in’ warning labels). The app, which was liked by majority of the participants for its functionality and usability, has the potential to support healthy dietary decision making and may also encourage reformulation.

"Ahmedani, Brian K.; Crotty, Nuala; Abdulhak, Muwaffak M.; Ondersma, Steven J.","Pilot feasibility study of a brief, tailored mobile health intervention for depression among patients with chronic pain","This pilot feasibility study investigated a brief, tailored mobile health intervention to provide brief treatment and motivate further depression treatment seeking among patients with comorbid chronic pain. The computer tablet intervention was delivered in a hospital clinic using a blended motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy approach. Individuals were at least age 18, and screened positive for depression during a visit for chronic pain. Participants completed assessments before the intervention and at two-week follow-up. The 64 participants were most often over 50 years old, female, and Caucasian. Participant ratings demonstrated an increase in interest to seek depression treatment and willingness to make life changes to mitigate symptoms. A significant reduction in mean depression score and non-significant reductions on both measures of disability were observed. This intervention was feasible and acceptable, demonstrated promise in reducing depression and increasing treatment interest, and should be tested in a trial.

"Ahn, Ahleum; Choi, Jaekyung",A one-way text messaging intervention for obesity,"Introduction: Worldwide, there has been a startling increase in the number of people who are obese or overweight. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. Mobile phone messaging is an important means of human communication globally. Because the mobile phone can be used anywhere at any time, mobile phone messaging has the potential to manage obesity. We investigated the effectiveness of a one-way text messaging intervention for obesity. Methods: Participants’ body mass index and waist circumference were measured at the beginning of the programme and again after 12 weeks. The text message group received text messages about exercise, dietary intake, and general information about obesity three times a week, while the control group did not receive any text messages from the study. Results: Of the 80 participants, 25 subjects in the text message group and 29 participants in the control group completed the study. After adjusting for baseline body mass index, the body mass index was significantly lower in the text message group than in the control group (27.9 vs 28.3; p = 0.02). After adjusting for the baseline waist circumference, the difference of waist circumference between the text message group and control group was not significant (93.4 vs 94.6; p = 0.13). Discussion: The one-way text messaging intervention was a simple and effective way to manage obesity. The one-way text messaging intervention may be a useful method for lifestyle modification in obese subjects.

Bikem; Trak, Ezgi; Tufan, Damla; Doron, Guy",Cognitive training using a mobile app as a coping tool against COVID-19 distress: A crossover randomized controlled trial,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been suggested to constitute a broad base stressor with severe mental health consequences. mHealth applications are accessible self-help tools that can be used to reduce psychological distress during the pandemic. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of mobile-based cognitive training exercises on COVID-19 related distress and maladaptive cognitions. Methods: Following initial screening ( n = 924), participants scoring 1 standard deviations above the mean of the COVID-19 Distress Scale were randomized into two groups. Participants in the immediate-app group (iApp; n = 25) started using the application at baseline (T0) for 12 days (from T0 to T1). Participants in the delayed-app group (dApp; n = 22) started using the mobile application at T1 (crossover) and used it for the following 12 days (T1 to T2). Results: Intention to treat analyses indicated that the iApp group exhibited lower COVID-19 distress, lower depression, fewer intolerance of uncertainty and obsessive beliefs than the dApp group at T1. In addition, using the app for 12 consecutive days was associated with large effect-size reductions (Cohen's d ranging from 0.81 to 2.35) in COVID-19 distress and related maladaptive cognitions in the iApp group (from T0 to T1) and the dApp group (from T1 to T2). Moreover, these reductions were maintained at the follow-up. Limitations: This study was a crossover trial with a relatively limited sample size and mainly female participants. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the usefulness of brief, low-intensity, portable interventions in alleviating the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health.

Design: Single-blind, randomized controlled study. Setting: A Faculty of Health Sciences. Subjects: A total of 65 patients with type 2 diabetes (47 women, 18 men). Intervention: Group A ( n = 22), control group—physical activity counselling once with a brochure. Group B ( n = 22), supervised group-based exercise, three days per week for eight weeks. Group C ( n = 21), Internet-based exercise following the same programme via a website. Main measures: Primary outcomes—glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, high-density and low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, and cholesterol. Secondary outcomes – waist and hip circumferences, body mass index, number of steps, six-minute walking test, and Euro-Quality of Life-5 Dimension. Results: After treatment, glycaemic control (mean change for Group B; Group C; –0.80%, –0.91%, P = 0.003), waist circumference (–4.23 cm, 5.64 cm, P = 0.006), and quality of life (0.26, 0.15, P = 0.013) significantly improved in both training groups compared with the control group. Fasting blood glucose (–46.86 mg/dL, P = 0.009) and hip circumference (–2.7 cm, P = 0.011) were significantly decreased in Group B and total cholesterol (–16.4 mg/dL, P = 0.028), six-minute walking distance (30.5 m, P = 0.01), and number of steps (1258.05, P = 0.023) significantly improved in Group C compared with control group. Group B and Group C changed with equal magnitude. Conclusion: In type 2 diabetes, supervised group-based and Internet-based exercise can improve equally glycaemic control, waist circumference, and quality of life, and both are better than simply counselling.

"Albers, Nele; Neerincx, Mark A.; Brinkman, Willem-Paul",Addressing people’s current and future states in a reinforcement learning algorithm for persuading to quit smoking and to be physically active,"Behavior change applications often assign their users activities such as tracking the number of smoked cigarettes or planning a running route. To help a user complete these activities, an application can persuade them in many ways. For example, it may help the user create a plan or mention the experience of peers. Intuitively, the application should thereby pick the message that is most likely to be motivating. In the simplest case, this could be the message that has been most effective in the past. However, one could consider several other elements in an algorithm to choose a message. Possible elements include the user’s current state (e.g., self-efficacy), the user’s future state after reading a message, and the user’s similarity to the users on which data has been gathered. To test the added value of subsequently incorporating these elements into an algorithm that selects persuasive messages, we conducted an experiment in which more than 500 people in four conditions interacted with a text-based virtual coach. The experiment consisted of five sessions, in each of which participants were suggested a preparatory activity for quitting smoking or increasing physical activity together with a persuasive message. Our findings suggest that adding more elements to the algorithm is effective, especially in later sessions and for people who thought the activities were useful. Moreover, while we found some support for transferring knowledge between the two activity types, there was rather low agreement between the optimal policies computed separately for the two activity types. This suggests limited policy generalizability between activities for quitting smoking and those for increasing physical activity. We see our results as supporting the idea of constructing more complex persuasion algorithms. Our dataset on 2,366 persuasive messages sent to 671 people is published together with this article for researchers to build on our algorithm.

"Alencar, Michelle; Johnson, Kelly; Gray, Virginia; Mullur, Rashmi; Gutierrez, Elizabeth; Dionico, Patricia",Telehealth-based health coaching increases m-health device adherence and rate of weight loss in obese participants,"Background: Healthy rate of weight loss (RWL) is defined as 1–2 lb of body weight loss per week. Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate changes in adherence to remote monitoring devices and RWL per week in response to a fully online, 12-week, medically monitored, weight management program incorporating weekly video-based health coaching (intervention group [INT]) versus self-guided (control group [CON]). Methods: Twenty-five obese participants (12 males, 13 females) were randomly assigned to either an INT (n = 13, 106.8 ± 25.46 kg, body mass index [BMI] = 35.19 ± 3.91 kg/m2) or CON group (n = 12, 99.8 ± 19.14 kg, BMI = 34.86 ± 4.43 kg/m2). Program related content was derived from inHealth Medical Services, Inc., Telehealth Enabled Approach to Multidisciplinary care (TEAM™) curriculum. All participants were given two wireless devices (Activity Pop and Body Scale; Withings®, Cambridge, MA) that connected them directly with the research team. The INT group connected via telehealth videoconferencing weekly for health coaching with the registered dietitian and monthly for medical monitoring with the physician, while the CON group did not. Both groups connected with the physician and registered dietitian at baseline to establish clinical goals and at the end to review progress. To analyze the data, independent samples t-tests and χ² tests were performed via SPSS v24 with data displayed as average ± SD; significance set to p < 0.05. Results: The INT group had increased device adherence when compared with CON (92% ± 10% vs. 75% ± 15% scale [p < 0.05]) and (80% ± 14% vs. 49% ± 15% tracker [p < 0.05]). Furthermore, RWL per week was greater in the INT when compared with CON; −0.74 ± 1.8 kg versus 0.18 ± 1.8 kg per week, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Weekly health coaching via telehealth can be an effective tool to increase remote device adherence and may help to induce a healthy RWL.

"Alexander, Adam C.; Waring, Joseph J. C.; Hébert, Emily T.; Ra, Chaelin Karen; Rangu, Neal; Kendzor, Darla E.; Businelle, Michael S.",Identifying mechanisms that link pain to smoking relapse during a quit attempt,"Objective: Emerging evidence suggests that adults with chronic pain have poor smoking cessation outcomes, but the exact mechanisms are less understood. This study examined whether depression, anxiety, stress, and then, positive outcome expectancy for smoking mediated the association between pain and smoking relapse during a quit attempt. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis of a three-armed randomized clinical trial that compared in-person and smartphone-based smoking cessation interventions. Participants (N = 81) self-reported the amount of bodily pain they experienced in the past 4 weeks at baseline. Depression, anxiety, stress, and positive outcome expectancy for smoking were measured daily, via a smartphone app, throughout the first week of the quit attempt, and were aggregated to the week level for analyses. Biochemically verified smoking abstinence was assessed 4 weeks postquit date. Results: Sequential mediation analyses showed that pain was indirectly associated with smoking relapse through greater feelings of stress and then higher expectations that smoking would improve mood (B = 0.22 [95% CI = 0.03, 0.65]). The pathways for depression and anxiety were not significant mediators of pain and smoking relapse. Conclusion: Findings from this study indicate that pain is indirectly associated with smoking relapse through feelings of stress and then positive outcome expectancy for smoking. Smoking cessation treatment for adults who experience high levels of bodily pain should include psychoeducation that teaches adaptive coping responses, such as mindfulness, to manage stress, and challenge expectations about the ability of smoking to improve mood.

"Alfonsson, Sven; Englund, Joakim; Parling, Thomas",Tailored text message prompts to increase therapy homework adherence: A single-case randomised controlled study,"Background: Psychotherapy homework completion is associated with positive treatment outcomes, but many patients show low adherence to prescribed assignments. Whether text-message prompts are effective in increasing adherence to assignments is unknown. Aims: To evaluate whether tailored daily text-message prompts can increase homework adherence in a stress/anxiety treatment. Method: This study used a randomised controlled single-case alternating treatment design with parallel replication in seven participants. Participants received a five-week relaxation program for stress and anxiety with daily exercises. The intervention consisted of daily text messages tailored for each participant. Phases with or without text messages were randomly alternated over the study course. Randomisation tests were used to statistically analyse differences in mean number of completed relaxation exercises between phases. Results: There was a significant (combined p = .018) effect of daily text messages on homework adherence across participants with weak to medium effect size improvements. No negative effects of daily text messages were identified. Conclusions: Tailored text messages can marginally improve adherence to assignments for patients in CBT. Further studies may investigate how text messages can be made relevant for more patients and whether text messages can be used to increase homework quality rather than quantity.

This study investigated the effects of eight weeks of aerobic exercise and vitamin D supplementation on psychiatric comorbidities in men with migraine and vitamin D insufficiency. Methods: Forty-eight participants took part in this randomized controlled clinical trial and were allocated into four groups: aerobic exercise and vitamin D (AE + VD), aerobic exercise and placebo (AE + Placebo), vitamin D (VD), and Placebo. AE + VD and AE + Placebo groups performed three aerobic exercise sessions per week for eight weeks and received a vitamin D supplement and placebo, respectively. The VD group received a vitamin D supplement, and the Placebo group received a placebo for eight weeks. The depression severity, quality of sleep, and physical self-concept were measured at baseline and after eight weeks. Results: The results showed that depression severity was significantly lower in AE + VD compared to AE + Placebo, VD, and Placebo at the post-test. Our results demonstrated that in the post-test, the mean score of sleep quality in AE + VD was significantly lower than AE + Placebo, VD, and Placebo. Finally, the results revealed that after eight weeks of intervention, the physical self-concept in AE + VD was significantly higher than in VD and Placebo groups. Limitations: Not having complete control of sun exposure and the diet were the limitations. Conclusion: The results indicated that the concomitant application of AE and VD supplementation could provoke synergistic effects leading to additional psycho-cognitive health benefits in men with migraine and vitamin D insufficiency.

We hypothesized that guided reflection and feedback would improve shared leadership and shared leadership capacity, and enhance team decision quality in TBL teams. We used the Kolb experiential learning theory as the theoretical framework. Method: The study was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Three TBL sessions with 206 students (39 teams) participated in the study. Using a quasi-experimental design, one batch received guided reflection and feedback on their team leadership processes ( n = 20 teams) and the other received only TBL ( n = 19 teams). Observers measured shared leadership using a checklist. Shared leadership capacity was measured using a questionnaire. Scores on a team application exercise were used to assess quality of team decisions. Results: Evidence did not support our first hypothesis that reflection and feedback enhance shared leadership in TBL teams. Percentages of teams displaying shared leadership did not differ between intervention and control groups in sessions 1 ( p = 0.6), 2 ( p = 1) or 3 ( p = 1). The results did not support the second hypothesis. We found no difference in quality of decision making between the intervention and control groups for sessions 1 ( p = 0.77), 2 ( p = 0.23), or 3 ( p = 0.07). The third hypothesis that the reflection and feedback would have an effect on shared leadership capacity was supported ( T = −8.55, p > 0.001 adjusted on baseline; T = −8.55, p > 0.001 adjusted on gender). Discussion and conclusion: We found that reflection and feedback improved shared leadership capacity but not shared leadership behaviors or team decision quality. We propose medical educators who apply TBL, should provide guided exercise in reflection and feedback so that students may better understand the benefits of working in teams as preparation for their future roles as leaders and members of health care teams.

Survivorship care guidelines emphasize the importance of attention to obesity, weight management, and physical activity. Mobile technologies have been effective for improving health behaviors among cancer survivors, though few studies have focused on AA BC survivors. Creating Healthy Actions through Technology (CHAT) was a 4-week pilot intervention that employed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to improve survivors’ physical activity and diet behaviors. We evaluated the acceptability, feasibility, and impact of a mHealth intervention for AA BC survivors. Participants ( N = 22) were randomized to intervention ( n = 13) or control ( n = 9). All participants completed daily EMAs via smartphone for 4 weeks and wore accelerometers for seven consecutive days at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks. Intervention participants additionally received tailored health messages. Diet was measured using a self-reported questionnaire and physical activity with accelerometers. Participant engagement was high. Of 84 EMA assessments, the average response was 63 (SD 16.1). Participant accelerometer wear was at least 6 of the 7 days (SD 1.7) for each assessment. Eighty-five percent of participants reported the intervention helped change behaviors. Intervention participants reduced their sedentary time by 4.37 (SD = 7.14) hours/day versus controls ( p = .05), reduced fast food intake by 1.5 servings ( p = 0.008), and increased vigorous activity by 0.56 (SD = 28.10) minutes, which was non-significant ( p = 0.959).

The aim of the study was to develop and implement teaching intervention strategies to generate an optimal motivational climate and assess their impact on different variables that affect students' situational motivation in Physical Education classes. The Achievement Goal Theory and the Self-determination Theory were taken as reference. Method: The intervention was based on the TARGET areas, developing an orientational teaching unit with the participation of 113 3 rd year ESO (secondary education) students (58 boys and 53 girls; M age = 14.83 and SD = 0.72), who were divided into an experimental group (n = 46) and a control group (n = 67). Different instruments were used to measure perceived motivational climate, basic psychological needs, self-determined situational motivation and affective consequences (satisfaction-enjoyment and boredom). Results: The results showed that the experimental group obtained significantly higher values with respect to the control group in the mastery motivational climate, as well as in autonomy, perceived competence, identified regulation and satisfaction-enjoyment. The amotivation values were significantly lower in the experimental group. Discussion: The results highlight the importance of the PE teacher transmitting task motivational climates to optimise different variables that affect motivation in PE classes, thus improving the teaching-learning process Conclusion. We highlight that the TARGET areas are effective to optimise the teaching intervention in the orientational content and to help improve the students' motivation in PE.

"Alqahtani, Felwah; Meier, Sandra; Orji, Rita",Personality-based approach for tailoring persuasive mental health applications,"Persuasive mental health applications (apps) are effective tools for promoting behavior change. Tailoring persuasive interventions can boost their effectiveness. Research has shown that there is a relationship between individuals’ personality traits and their susceptibility to various features of a persuasive app. The aim of this paper was twofold. First, we explore the relationships between personality and features of a persuasive app for promoting mental and emotional well-being. Second, we explore possible domain-dependent variability on the relation between personality and persuasive features across various domains (e.g., habit formation, fitness, risky behaviors change, transportation habits). Specifically, to advance research in the area of personality and computing app design, first, we reviewed 103 mental health apps from the app stores and uncovered the various persuasive features employed in their design. Second, we conducted focus-group studies of 32 participants to uncover more insights about the mental health app features. Finally, we implemented the common features that emerged from these two studies in persuasive mental health app prototypes and conducted a large-scale study of 561 users to evaluate their persuasiveness depending on people’s personalities. The results of the large-scale study show that people’s personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness of different features—the app features that appeal to various individuals. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by apps that offer relaxation audios, encouragement, suggestions and trusted information, contact for help; Neurotic people are more inclined to apps that provide some relaxation exercises and audios, social support, and apps with a clear privacy policy; People who are more open to experience tend to be motivated by self-monitoring, relaxation exercises and audios, and social support. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of the relationship between personality traits and persuasive features across various domains to show domain dependency of persuasive feature effectiveness and offer design guidelines for tailoring persuasive and behavior change apps based on an individual’s personality.

Feedback that provides reinforcement has the potential to increase dietary self-monitoring and enhance attainment of recommended dietary intake. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of daily feedback (DFB) messages, delivered remotely, on changes in dietary intake. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the Self- Monitoring And Recording using Technology (SMART) Trial, a single-center, 24-month randomized clinical trial of behavioral treatment for weight loss. Participants included 210 obese adults (mean body mass index, 34.0 kg/m²) who were randomized to either a paper diary (PD), personal digital assistant (PDA), or PDA plus daily tailored feedback messages (PDA + FB). To determine the role of daily tailored feedback in dietary intake, we compared the self-monitoring with DFB group (DFB group; n = 70) with the self-monitoring without DFB group (no-DFB group, n = 140). All participants received a standard behavioral intervention for weight loss. Self-reported changes in dietary intake were compared between the DFB and no-DFB groups and were measured at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Linear mixed modeling was used to examine percentage changes in dietary intake from baseline. Results: Compared with the no-DFB group, the DFB group achieved a larger reduction in energy (–22.8% vs –14.0%; P = .02) and saturated fat (–11.3% vs -0.5%; P = .03) intake and a trend toward a greater decrease in total fat intake (–10.4% vs –4.7%; P = .09). There were significant improvements over time in carbohydrate intake and total fat intake for both groups ( P values < .05).

While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. Methods: The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to “during” and “before” home confinement. Results: Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease ( p < .001 and Δ% = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing “during” compared to “before” home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire showed a significant increase by 44.9% ( p < .001) in SMFQ total score with more people (+10%) showing depressive symptoms “during” compared to “before” home confinement. Conclusion: The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.

"Anderson, Gaynell",Physical therapy treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction: Multifaceted approach,"Background and purpose: Pelvic Floor Disorders (PFD) have gained recognition in the health care arena, not only due to rising incidence, but also due to rising health care costs and economic burdens. Because of the diverse and multifactorial nature of both impairments and symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, successful treatment outcomes have been difficult. The purpose of this case report was to demonstrate the application of an encompassing physical therapy approach to the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction and demonstrate functional outcomes towards return to optimal pain free function. Case Description: The patient was an otherwise healthy, ectomorphic 63-year-old female with insidious onset of diverse pelvic symptoms including left groin/hip pain, bilateral thigh pain, low back pain, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, and irregular defecation. Symptoms were moderate to severe, with patient reporting functional and leisure activity level at 10% to that of her normal level. Physical therapy evaluation and interventions focused on areas of involvement including the pelvic floor, the pelvic girdle, and the diaphragm and integrated various treatment techniques including manual therapy and exercise prescription with patient preference direction. Functional outcomes were determined through objective measures of involved tissues, subjective measure tools including Lower Extremity Functional Score (LEFS) and pelvic floor questionnaire (short form 7), and patient subjective input. Following physical therapy interventions and Total Hip Arthroplasty, the patient reported achieving pain free function with dissipation of all subjective complaints and improved objective measures of all components contributing to measures of pelvic girdle stabilization, strength, mobility, and coordinated functioning.

"Anderson-Bill, Eileen Smith; Winett, Richard A.; Wojcik, Janet R.","Social cognitive determinants of nutrition and physical activity among web-health users enrolling in an online intervention: The influence of social support, self efficacy, outcomes expectations, and self-regulation","Background: The Internet is a trusted source of health information for growing majorities of Web users. The promise of online health interventions will be realized with the development of purely online theory-based programs for Web users that are evaluated for program effectiveness and the application of behavior change theory within the online environment. Little is known, however, about the demographic, behavioral, or psychosocial characteristics of Web-health users who represent potential participants in online health promotion research. Nor do we understand how Web users’ psychosocial characteristics relate to their health behavior—information essential to the development of effective, theory-based online behavior change interventions. Objective: This study examines the demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of Web-health users recruited for an online social cognitive theory (SCT)-based nutrition, physical activity, and weight gain prevention intervention, the Web-based Guide to Health (WB-GTH). Methods: Directed to the WB-GTH site by advertisements through online social and professional networks and through print and online media, participants were screened, consented, and assessed with demographic, physical activity, psychosocial, and food frequency questionnaires online (taking a total of about 1.25 hours); they also kept a 7-day log of daily steps and minutes walked. Results: From 4700 visits to the site, 963 Web users consented to enroll in the study: 83% (803) were female, participants’ mean age was 44.4 years (SD 11.03 years), 91% (873) were white, and 61% (589) were college graduates; participants’ median annual household income was approximately US $85,000. Participants’ daily step counts were in the low-active range (mean 6485.78, SD 2352.54) and overall dietary levels were poor (total fat g/day, mean 77.79, SD 41.96; percent kcal from fat, mean 36.51, SD 5.92; fiber g/day, mean 17.74, SD 7.35; and fruit and vegetable servings/day, mean 4.03, SD 2.33). The Web-health users had good self-efficacy and outcome expectations for health behavior change; however, they perceived little social support for making these changes and engaged in few self-regulatory behaviors. Consistent with SCT, theoretical models provided good fit to Web-users’ data (root mean square error of the approximation [RMSEA] < .05). Perceived social support and use of self-regulatory behaviors were strong predictors of physical activity and nutrition behavior. Web users’ self-efficacy was also a good predictor of healthier levels of physical activity and dietary fat but not of fiber, fruits, and vegetables. Social support and self-efficacy indirectly predicted behavior through self-regulation, and social support had indirect effects through self-efficacy. Conclusions: Results suggest Web-health users visiting and ultimately participating in online health interventions may likely be middle-aged, well-educated, upper middle class women whose detrimental health behaviors put them at risk of obesity, heart disease, some cancers, and diabetes. The success of Internet physical activity and nutrition interventions may depend on the extent to which they lead users to develop self-efficacy for behavior change, but perhaps as important, the extent to which these interventions help them garner social-support for making changes. Success of these interventions may also depend on the extent to which they provide a platform for setting goals, planning, tracking, and providing feedback on targeted behaviors.

"Anderson-Bill, Eileen Smith; Winett, Richard A.; Wojcik, Janet R.; Winett, Sheila G.","Web-based guide to health: Relationship of theoretical variables to change in physical activity, nutrition and weight at 16-months","Background: Evaluation of online health interventions should investigate the function of theoretical mechanisms of behavior change in this new milieu. Objectives: To expand our understanding of how Web-based interventions influence behavior, we examined how changes at 6 months in participants’ psychosocial characteristics contributed to improvements at 16 months in nutrition, physical activity (PA), and weight management as a result of the online, social cognitive theory (SCT)-based Guide to Health intervention (WB-GTH). Methods: We conducted recruitment, enrollment, and assessments online with 272 of 655 (41.5%) participants enrolling in WB-GTH who also completed 6- and 16-month follow-up assessments. Participants’ mean age was 43.68 years, 86% were female, 92% were white, mean education was 17.45 years, median income was US $85,000, 84% were overweight or obese, and 73% were inactive. Participants received one of two equally effective versions of WB-GTH. Structural equation analysis of theoretical models evaluated whether psychosocial constructs targeted by WB-GTH contributed to observed health behavior changes. Results: The longitudinal model provided good fit to the data (root mean square error of approximation total = -.34, P = .01), consumption of fruits and vegetables (F&V) (beta total = -.20, P = .03) and calorie intake (beta total = .15, P = .04). Improvements at 6 months in PA self-efficacy (beta total = -.10, P = .03), PA self-regulation (beta total = -.15, P = .01), nutrition social support (beta total = -.08, P = .03), and nutrition outcome expectations (betatotal = .08, P = .03) also contributed to weight loss. WB-GTH users with increased social support (betatotal = .26, P = .04), self-efficacy (beta total = .30, P = .01), and self-regulation (beta total = .45, P = .004) also exhibited improved PA levels. Decreased fat and sugar consumption followed improved social support (beta total = -.10, P = .02), outcome expectations (beta total= .15, P = .007), and self-regulation (beta total = -.14, P = .008). Decreased calorie intake followed increased social support (beta total = -.30, P < .001). Increased F&V intake followed improved self-efficacy (beta total = .20, P = .01), outcome expectations (beta total = -.29, P = .002), and self-regulation (beta total = .27, P = .009). Theorized indirect effects within SCT variables were also supported. Conclusions: The WB-GTH influenced behavior and weight loss in a manner largely consistent with SCT. Improving social support, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulation, in varying combinations, led to healthier diet and exercise habits and concomitant weight loss. High initial levels of self-efficacy may be characteristic of Web-health users interested in online interventions and may alter the function of SCT in these programs. Researchers may find that, although increased self-efficacy enhances program outcomes, participants whose self-efficacy is tempered by online interventions may still benefit.

"Andersson, Christina","Compassionate mind training and its relationship with perceived stress, poor mental health, self-compassion and benevolence","Background: University students and employees are two populations where stress-related problems, anxiety, and depression are increasing. Interventions must be found to reverse this trajectory and to improve mental health. Research on self-compassion and compassion training as a strategy to handle high levels of perceived stress, depression, and anxiety has increased internationally during the last years. Accessibility to new effective health programs is important to spur the development within this field of psychology and mental health forward. Further, testing different delivery formats is important both in regard to accessibility as well as cost and time efficiency.Aims: The purpose of this thesis was to develop a compassionate mind training intervention and examine its effects on mental health and stress-related problems in two groups of adults (university students and employees). Furthermore, the prosocial concept of benevolence was measured to increase the understanding of the concept and its relation to self-compassion, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion.Four studies were performed. The aim of the first study was to evaluate the effects of compassionate mind training on stress-related problems in university students compared with affect-focused training. Study II's aim was to evaluate the effect of compassionate mind training provided by a digital mental health solution using a smartphone application on stress-related problems in university students compared with an active control group following a mindfulness program using a smartphone application and a passive waitlist control group, respectively. In study III, the aim was to evaluate the effect of compassionate mind training on stress-related problems among employees in two work organizations compared with physical exercise. Study IV investigated the associations between the psychological concepts of benevolence and stress, mental ill-health, and self-compassion among employees.Study I: Comparing the effects of compassionate mind training to an affect-focused training on university students with self-defined high levels of stress.Study II: Comparing the effects of digital compassionate mind training to an active control consisting of digital mindfulness training and a passive waitlist control on university students with stress-related problems.Study III: Comparing the effects of compassionate mind training to physical exercise on employees with self-defined high perceived stress in two organizations.Study IV: Investigating the associations between the psychological concept of benevolence and perceived stress, mental ill-health (e.g., emotional exhaustion, anxiety, and depression symptoms), satisfaction with life, and self-compassion among employees in two datasets.Methods: A compassionate mind training program was developed and evaluated in randomized controlled trials (studies I, II and III) and the data were analyzed by mixed effects models. Study IV used a cross-sectional design. An informed consent form was filled out by all participants in each study.Study I included 55 Swedish university students (mean age = 26) randomized to compassionate mind training (n = 28) and affect-focused training (n = 27). Assessment was done at pre- and posttraining evaluating participants' self-reports on a self-compassion scale short form (SCS-SF), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and perceived stress scale (PSS-14).

"Andersson, Stig Haugsboe; Bahr, Roald; Olsen, Magnus Johnsen; Myklebust, Grethe","Attitudes, beliefs, and behavior toward shoulder injury prevention in elite handball: Fertile ground for implementation","We aimed to examine attitudes, beliefs, and current behavior toward risk factors and prevention of shoulder injuries, and to investigate the application of an exercise program during a cluster‐randomized controlled trial aiming to prevent shoulder injuries in elite handball. All captains and coaches of 44 elite handball teams (22 male and 22 female) constituting the intervention (21 teams) and control arm (n = 23 teams) in the trial were invited to take part in a survey. A questionnaire, based on the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework, addressing the end user perspective on risk factors and prevention of shoulder injuries, as well as key issues related to the application of the Oslo Sports Trauma Research Center (OSTRC) Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme, was distributed using electronic survey software. The response rate was 100%. Overall, the majority of coaches (84%) and captains (89%) believed that handball players are at high risk for shoulder injuries. All delivery agents in the trial reported to be familiar with the exercise program and the majority believed in a preventative effect (coaches 90% and captains 81%). Only a minority reported full compliance with the recommended frequency (coaches 29%, captains 14%), with program being too time‐consuming (coaches 67%, captains 81%) and lack of player motivation (coaches 76%, captains 62%) as the main barriers. Our results suggest that there is fertile ground for implementation of the OSTRC Shoulder Injury Prevention Programme in elite handball, with program length and lack of player motivation as the main barriers to overcome.

"Andrade, Andre Q.; Beleigoli, Alline; De Fatima Diniz, Maria; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz",Influence of baseline user characteristics and early use patterns (24-hour) on long-term adherence and effectiveness of a web-based weight loss randomized controlled trial: Latent profile analysis,"Background: Low adherence to real-world online weight loss interventions reduces long-term efficacy. Baseline characteristics and use patterns are determinants of long-term adherence, but we lack cohesive models to guide how to adapt interventions to users' needs. We also lack information whether very early use patterns (24 hours) help describe users and predict interventions they would benefit from. Objective: We aim to understand the impact of users' baseline characteristics and early (initial 24 hours) use patterns of a web platform for weight loss on user adherence and weight loss in the long term (24 weeks). Methods: We analyzed data from the POEmaS randomized controlled trial, a study that compared the effectiveness of a weight loss platform with or without coaching and a control approach. Data included baseline behavior and use logs from the initial 24 hours after platform access. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify classes, and Kruskal-Wallis was used to test whether class membership was associated with long-term (24 weeks) adherence and weight loss. Results: Among 828 participants assigned to intervention arms, 3 classes were identified through LPA: class 1 (better baseline health habits and high 24-hour platform use); class 2 (better than average health habits, but low 24-hour platform use); class 3 (worse baseline health habits and low 24-hour platform use). Class membership was associated with long-term adherence (P<.001), and class 3 members had the lowest adherence. Weight loss was not associated with class membership (P=.49), regardless of the intervention arm (platform only or platform + coach). However, class 2 users assigned to platform + coach lost more weight than those assigned to platform only (P=.02). Conclusions: Baseline questionnaires and use data from the first 24 hours after log-in allowed distinguishing classes, which were associated with long-term adherence. This suggests that this classification might be a useful guide to improve adherence and assign interventions to individual users.

"Antony, Jiju; Sivanathan, Laxman; Gijo, E. V.",Design of experiments in a higher education setting,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of Design of Experiments (DoE) in a higher education setting and to remove the misconception that it is only applied to a manufacturing environment. The authors demonstrate a simple case study here to illustrate its application in a typical non-manufacturing context. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology involves the execution of a simple study in the form of an experiment in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Strathclyde. The experiment was performed with the assistance of both undergraduate and postgraduate students in one department in the Faculty of Engineering. Findings: It was found from the experiment that postgraduate students prefer a case study approach of teaching with multiple speakers and prefer their classes in the morning. As for undergraduate students, similar results were obtained but would prefer their classes in the afternoon. Moreover further analysis shows that the postgraduate students prefer a 30 minutes introduction to the topic in a one hour lecture. Moreover the students prefer more time to be spent on the exercises and less time on the discussion. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of the experiment was considered small in the study although this was a pilot study to investigate the use of DoE in a higher education setting. The authors will continue to collect more data for further validity of results obtained from the pilot study. The authors will also explore the use of different designs as part of the future investigations. Practical implications: The outcome of this experiment would help everyone who is involved in teaching to understand the factors and their influences to improve students’ satisfaction scores during the delivery of teaching. Originality/value: This paper shows how DoE as a pure manufacturing technique can be extended to a higher education setting. The results of this study were quite an eye opener for the authors in terms of understanding the key factors which influence any process irrespective of the sector.

It would therefore be good to identify mechanisms for reinforcing advice and one option is the use of information and communication technologies. Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of such technologies, we decided to conduct a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a mobile application (app) for supporting the provision health advice for weight loss. Methods: A randomized clinical trial with 110 obese and overweight patients from the Basque public health care network (Araba). Patients were randomly allocated to the control (health advice) or intervention (health advice + app) groups. Primary (weight) and secondary (blood cholesterol level, blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations) outcome variables were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of the intervention. Results: There were no significant differences in weight (0.357 kg; P = 0.7), blood cholesterol (2.6 mg/dl; P = 0.617), blood pressure (2.3 mmHg; P = 0.369) or adherence to recommendations on diet (84.6% in control and 92.9% the intervention group, P = 0.413) or physical activity (56% in controls and 75% the intervention group, P = 0.145). On the other hand, there were significant differences in HbA1c in favour of the control group (−0.095%; %; P = 0.046). Discussion: The use of AKTIDIET® to support health advice for weight loss cannot be recommended. More high quality studies are needed, and patients should be involved in the design of apps to increase their efficacy and usability. Clinical trial registration NCT02308176.

"Apovian, Caroline M.; Garvey, W. Timothy; Ryan, Donna H.","Challenging obesity: Patient, provider, and expert perspectives on the roles of available and emerging nonsurgical therapies","Objective: Adult obesity is recognized as a chronic disease. According to principles of chronic disease management, healthcare professionals should work collaboratively with patients to determine appropriate therapeutic strategies that address overweight and obesity, specifically considering a patient's disease status in addition to their individual needs, preferences, and attitudes regarding treatment. A central role and responsibility of healthcare professionals in this process is to inform and educate patients about their treatment options. Although current recommendations for the management of adult obesity provide general guidance regarding safe and proper implementation of lifestyle, pharmacological, and surgical interventions, healthcare professionals need awareness of specific evidence‐based information that supports individualized clinical application of these therapies. More specifically, healthcare professionals should be up‐to‐date on approaches that promote successful lifestyle management and be knowledgeable about newer weight loss pharmacotherapies, so they can offer patients with obesity a wide range of options to personalize their treatment. Accordingly, this educational activity has been developed to provide participants with the latest information on treatment recommendations and therapeutic advances in lifestyle intervention and pharmacotherapy for adult obesity management. Design and Methods: This supplement is based on the content presented at a live CME symposium held in conjunction with ObesityWeek 2014. Results: This supplement provides an expert summary of current treatment recommendations and recent advances in nonsurgical therapies for the management of adult obesity. Patient and provider perspectives on obesity management are highlighted in embedded video clips available via QR codes, and new evidence will be applied using clinically relevant case studies. Conclusions: This supplement provides a topical update of obesity management, including clinical practice examples, for healthcare professionals who treat or provide care for adults with obesity.

Methods: Initially, the researchers, based on literature, developed a bank of 68 SMS text messages focusing on healthy eating (24 messages), physical activity (24 messages), and motivational feedback (20 messages), based on a scoping review of the literature on promoting behavioral change to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors. In the next step, a panel of five experts analyzed every subset of SMS text messages. Further validation was conducted by nine older adults (≥ 60 years). The user demographics, telephone literacy, understanding, and appeal for every SMS text message were evaluated using a 31-item questionnaire. Results: Participants provided an acceptable understanding of the critical concept found in the 49 SMS text message (physical activity M = 1.73 ± 0.18; diet M = 1.73 ± 0.26; motivation M = 1.85 ± 0.25; range 0–2). The average ratings for physical activity (i.e., likability), healthy eating, and motivation were 8.62 ± 0.64, 8.57 ± 0.76, and 8.40 ± 0.83, respectively (range 0–10). Conclusion: Co-designers were able to identify the technological and content requirements for each text message and infographic to enhance understanding and appeal. Practice implications: A feasibility study will need to be conducted as a next step to testing the effectiveness of text messages in a mobile-based intervention to promote healthy behaviors in older adults at high CVD risk.

"Arguello, Eric Matthew",The effects of focal cooling on dynamic neuromuscular control and knee biomechanics,"Objective. To determine whether focal knee cooling attenuates dynamic postural stability or decreases knee laxity and hamstring flexibility as compared to a room temperature trial. Design . Single-group, pretest-posttest control session design. Setting. University exercise physiology laboratory. Participants . Fourteen healthy college students (24 ± 3 years old). Intervention. Twenty-minute 5°C cooling pad application to the knee vs. room temperature (no cooling). Main Outcome Measures. Postural stability, anterior knee laxity and hamstring flexibility were measured before, immediately after and 20 minutes after either no cooling or a cooling pad application for 20 minutes. Skin temperature (lateral knee joint line) and subcutaneous temperature (medial knee joint line) were recorded every 5 minutes for the entire 20-minute treatment and for the 20-minute period following application. Results. Mean medial-lateral deflection (frontal plane position) measurement of postural stability increased immediately following cooling from .60 ± .59 to .93 ± .80. Anterior knee laxity decreased immediately following cooling from 8.40 ± .79 to 7.48 ± .78 mm. These differences were no longer evident following 20 minutes of rewarming at room temperature. Hamstring flexibility did not change with cooling. Skin temperatures decreased with cooling from 30.34 ± .89 to 18.26 ± 2.28°C and remained lower (24.99 ± .93°C) following 20 minutes of rewarming. Subcutaneous temperatures decreased with cooling from 28.40 ± 1.41 to 16.13 ± 2.59°C and remained lower (21.94 ± 1.38°C) following 20 minutes of rewarming. Conclusion. Application of a cooling pad to the knee attenuates or alters dynamic neuromuscular control in the frontal plane and decreases knee compliance immediately following the application. Cold treatment is commonly used following acute injury in sport and exercise. Alterations in the dynamic joint stability and biomechanic properties of the knee with cooling may increase the risk of injury if exercise or sport is resumed immediately following cold treatment.

"Arigo, Danielle; Pasko, Kristen; Mogle, Jacqueline A.",Daily relations between social perceptions and physical activity among college women,"Objectives: There is a need to develop more effective physical activity (PA) promotion programs for college women. Theory and evidence suggest that perceptions of the social environment play a role in college women’s PA, though little is known about how these perceptions are associated with PA at the day level. The goal of this study was to examine relations between changes in college women’s daily social perceptions and objectively assessed PA over seven days. Design: Daily diary method. Method: College women ( n = 80, M Age = 20, M BMI = 23.1 kg/m²) wore Fitbit wristbands and completed daily self-reports of (1) the quantity and perceived intensity of their social interactions (positive/negative), and (2) the occurrence of social comparisons (based on appearance/health/status) for seven days. Results: Multilevel models showed daily variability in predictors and outcomes ( ps < 0.0001), as well as relations between within-person changes in social perceptions and PA. Increases in negative interactions (particularly those with friends) were consistently associated with decreases in daily PA, whereas increases in positive interactions showed limited relations ( srs = −0.22-0.34). Days with health comparisons were days with greater PA for women who had stronger overall interest in comparisons, but were days with less PA for women with weaker overall interest ( srs = 0.22–0.33). PA did not differ between days with vs. without appearance comparisons. Conclusions: Social perceptions show meaningful day-to-day variability and relations with college women’s daily PA, and specific associations may be useful for improving tailored interventions for college women.

Fifty-eight participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG, n = 31) or a control group (CG, n = 27). After 1 week of baseline assessment, the IG received stAPP (i.e. smartphone, smartphone app and corresponding motion sensor) and used it during the following week. CG participants were monitored during 2 weeks without receiving stAPP. Total daily sitting time and prolonged sitting bouts (> 30 min bouts of sitting) were objectively assessed using activPAL3 inclinometers. Although no significant changes emerged in the CG in any of the sitting parameters, total sitting time (on weekdays; p = 0.032), number of prolonged sitting bouts (> 30 min of sitting) [both on week- ( p < 0.001) and weekend days ( p = 0.008)] and average duration of prolonged sitting bouts [both on week- ( p = 0.004) and weekend days ( p = 0.029)] decreased significantly in the IG. The stAPP smartphone-based intervention constitutes a promising intervention tool to interrupt and reduce prolonged sitting behavior. Further long-term studies on a larger scale are needed to further explore the effectiveness of a smartphone-based intervention aimed at reducing prolonged sitting behavior.

"Aschbrenner, Kelly A.; Naslund, John A.; Gorin, Amy A.; Mueser, Kim T.; Browne, Julia; Wolfe, Rosemarie S.; Xie, Haiyi; Bartels, Stephen J.",Group lifestyle intervention with mobile health for young adults with serious mental illness: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Evidence-based lifestyle interventions tailored to young adults with serious mental illness are needed to reduce their cardiometabolic risk. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a group lifestyle intervention (“PeerFIT”) enhanced with mobile health (mHealth) compared with one-on-one mHealth coaching (basic education supported by activity tracking [BEAT]) for young adults with serious mental illness who were overweight or obese. Methods: Participants were young adults ages 18–35 years with serious mental illness and a body mass index ≥25 kg/m², who were randomly assigned to PeerFIT or BEAT. Research staff collected data at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Main outcomes were clinically significant changes from baseline in weight ($5% weight loss), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF; increase of .50 m on the 6-minute walk test), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction (clinically significant weight loss or CRF improvement). Results: Participants were 150 young adults with amean6SD body mass index of 37.1± 67.4. Intent-to-treat analyses revealed no significant between-group difference for weight-loss, CRF, or CVD outcomes at 6 and 12 months. Participants in both conditions achieved clinically significant CVD risk reduction, weight loss, and CRF from baseline to 6 and 12 months, and all these improvements were statistically significant (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The PeerFIT group lifestyle intervention was not superior to one-on-one mHealth coaching in achieving clinically significant changes in weight, CRF, and CVD risk reduction. Although both interventions improved outcomes, low-intensity mHealth coaching may be a more scalable approach for addressing modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors among young adults with serious mental illness.

"Aschbrenner, Kelly A.; Naslund, John A.; Shevenell, Megan; Kinney, Elizabeth; Bartels, Stephen J.",A pilot study of a peer-group lifestyle intervention enhanced with mHealth technology and social media for adults with serious mental illness,"This pilot study examined the preliminary effectiveness of a peer-group lifestyle intervention enhanced with mobile health technology and social media for obese individuals with serious mental illness. Thirty-two participants with a body mass index of 30 or higher received a 24-week intervention designed to facilitate peer support for lifestyle change through experiential learning and use of wearable activity tracking devices, smartphone applications, and Facebook to reinforce physical activity, healthy eating, and group participation between sessions. The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary measures included fitness and participants' perceptions of peer-group support. Most participants (72%) lost weight, including 28% achieving clinically significant weight loss, and 17% of participants showed clinically significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness. Weight loss was associated with perceived peer-group support. This evaluation demonstrated the preliminary effectiveness of a potentially scalable peer-group lifestyle intervention delivered in community mental health settings for obese individuals with serious mental illness.

NAO was controlled by a neurally-inspired model that enables motions synchronization between robot and human. Using a robot has the advantage in that it can be modified and controlled without being influenced by the human with whom they are interacting. More specifically, we were interested in non-intentional interpersonal coordination which has been found in previous studies to be preserved for SZ. We performed an experiment in which we asked patients and control participants to jointly perform fitness movements with the robot which was programmed to either synchronize with the human (a bidirectional condition) or move at a fixed frequency with them (a unidirectional condition). We showed that non-intentional interpersonal coordination was preserved for SZ during Human/Robot interaction (as for human/human interaction). Also, the best synchronization, stability and the best performance in term of speed were obtained with the bidirectional condition. Our results showed that, in this specific context of an interaction at preferential frequency of subject, there were only a few differences between SZ and controls in terms of interpersonal synchronization skills. Nevertheless, we observed more variability for SZ which could partly be explained by the weaker intrapersonal coordination that they exhibited.

Design and Setting: A quantitative, multi-state, nonequivalent comparison group pretest-posttest design was used to compare nutrition-related behavior changes in participants. ESBA was compared to previously used curricula for 3 different time periods in 5 states using the EFNEP evaluation tool. Participants: Adults enrolled in EFNEP who completed their entry and exit paperwork during any of the 3 time points. Intervention: An 8-lesson adult curriculum based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and MyPlate. Analysis: Analysis of variance and covariance (with pretests scores and demographic variables as covariates) were used to analyze data with significance at P ≤ .05. Results: ESBA elicited a mean positive behavior change for food resource management ( P < .01), food safety ( P ≤ .001), nutrition ( P < .001), and physical activity level in participating states ( P ≤ .01). Compared with previous curricula, ESBA produced better mean outcomes in food resource management, nutrition, physical activity, and intakes of fruit and vegetables. Conclusion and Implications: ESBA is effective at eliciting positive nutrition-related behavior change. The results of this multi-state, practice-based approach suggest that ESBA is effective in multiple settings and has external validity for use in EFNEP and other community nutrition programs.

"Avery, Derek R.; McKay, Patrick F.; Volpone, Sabrina D.; Malka, Ari",Are companies beholden to bias? The impact of leader race on consumer purchasing behavior,"Given that racial stereotypes often influence leader appraisals, many businesses assume consumers will respond unfavorably to Black leaders. Recent research, however, suggests observers may suppress negative stereotypes of Black leaders when they head high-performing organizations. We integrate theory on implicit leadership and motivated social cognition to better understand how leader stereotype application and suppression influence consumer purchasing behavior. Across archival studies, a classroom exercise, and an experiment, we found that customers (real and prospective) appraised Black leaders less favorably than White leaders, resulting in lower patronage only when motivated to view leaders stereotypically. Namely, significant consumer bias against companies with Black leaders emerged only when organizational failure was accompanied by (a) unfamiliarity with the leader(s) in question, (b) greater societal acceptance of racist behavior (i.e., in the past), or (c) high consumer desire to bask-in-reflected-glory of an organization.

"Backes, Todd Patrick",The effect of exercise intensity and fluid restriction on cognitive function and salivary measures in division III male and female endurance athletes,"It is well documented how even modest dehydration can be detrimental to physiological functions in endurance based athletic competition. Previous work has examined decreases in power output, force, and time to exhaustion as well as physiological variables such as the appearance of changes in hormone levels as they relate to success in various endurance sports/activities such as running, swimming, cycling and rowing. Success in athletic competition, however, is not solely limited to enhancing endurance aspects alone. Cognitive function plays an important role in competition. The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of exercise on the appearance of salivary alpha amylase, cortisol and testosterone and to examine the effect of exercise on cognitive function both under modest fluid restriction (<3% Body Weight). The subjects were NCAA Division III male and female athletes that participate in team based sports such as soccer, basketball, rugby and volleyball. Apparently healthy subjects were screened had aerobic fitness and body composition determined in the first of three lab visits. The second and third lab consisted of identical treadmill exercise paired with two different fluid interventions. Prior to the treadmill exercise and immediately after both moderate and high intensity exercise cognitive function was measured via the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) program. Saliva and urine collections were taken prior to the exercise and immediately following exercise termination. Five cognitive tests were selected from the ANAM test battery and analyzed. The results showed that cognition was impacted by the exercise protocol and fluid condition individually and by an interaction between the exercise protocol and fluid condition. Cognition was affected differently at moderate intensity exercise dependant on fluid condition. Cognition was also impacted by the gender of the subject. We demonstrate in this study that exercise, both moderate and high intensity, elicits a significant increase in salivary cortisol, salivary testosterone, and salivary alpha-amylase. This change was irrespective of fluid condition. Additionally, the fluid condition had an effect on cortisol and had an effect (along with gender) on alpha-amylase. Fluid condition effects were evident in females rather than males. For testosterone there was also an interaction effect of exercise and gender. This research is unique in its application to subjects who are involved in team based sports as well as using both male and female athletes. The use of both female and male athletes reveals results that support differences in suggested hydration strategies based on gender. Whereas previous work has looked at physiological responses to dehydration and performance skills independently, this research will use a very sophisticated measure of cognitive function along with the examination of physiological responses. This research can be the basis for future studies that focus on athletes who are involved in sports in which performance is based on reaction, and decision making.

For this quasiexperimental study with a nonequivalent control group, 54 shift‐work nurses were recruited from two general wards at a hospital in Korea and assigned to the intervention and control groups. Nurses in the intervention group were encouraged to exercise regularly using the home workout application for 18 weeks. For the first 12 weeks, text‐message counseling and environmental improvement were carried out; only environmental improvement was implemented in the remaining 12–18 weeks. The control group did not receive any intervention. After excluding dropouts, the data of the final 25 participants in the intervention group and 24 participants in the control group were analyzed. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed statistically significant improvements in physical and psychological health. Hospital organizations could adopt a smartphone‐based home workout program to overcome obstacles to exercise, which could lead to positive health outcomes for shift‐work nurses.

The current article examines two aspects of VR that uniquely contribute to media interactivity: the ability to capture and review physical behavior and the ability to see one's avatar rendered in real time from third person points of view. In two studies, we utilized a state-of-the-art, image-based tele-immersive system, capable of tracking and rendering many degrees of freedom of human motion in real time. In Experiment 1, participants learned better in VR than in a video learning condition according to self report measures, and the cause of the advantage was seeing one's avatar stereoscopically in the third person. In Experiment 2, we added a virtual mirror in the learning environment to further leverage the ability to see oneself from novel angles in real time. Participants learned better in VR than in video according to objective performance measures. Implications for learning via interactive digital media are discussed.

One of the most popular and widely used brands of PA trackers is Fitbit. Since the release of the first Fitbit in 2009, hundreds of experimental studies have used Fitbit devices to facilitate PA self-monitoring and behavior change via goal setting and feedback tools. Fitbit's ability to capture large volumes of PA and physiological data in real time creates enormous opportunities for researchers. At the same time, however, it introduces a number of challenges (eg, technological, operational, logistical), most of which are not sufficiently described in study publications. Currently, there are no technical reports, guidelines, nor other types of publications discussing some of these challenges and offering guidance to researchers on how to best incorporate Fitbit devices in their study design and intervention to achieve their research goals. As a result, researchers are often left alone to discover and address some of these issues during the study through ""trial and error."" This paper aims to address this gap. Drawing on our cumulative experience of conducting multiple studies with various Fitbit PA trackers over the years, we present and discuss various key challenges associated with the use of Fitbit PA trackers in research studies. Difficulties with the use of Fitbit PA trackers are encountered throughout the entire research process. Challenges and solutions are categorized in 4 main categories: study preparation, intervention delivery, data collection and analysis, and study closeout. Subsequently, we describe a number of empirically tested strategies used in 4 of our interventional studies involving participants from a broad range of demographic characteristics, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and literacy levels. Researchers should be prepared to address challenges and issues in a timely fashion to ensure that the Fitbit effectively assists participants and researchers in achieving research and outcome goals.

"Ball, Natalie","The effect of blood flow restriction training on thigh circumference, strength, and neuromuscular control in an adult male post hip arthroscopy","Background and Purpose. Blood flow restriction training (BFR) is an emerging intervention focusing on increasing muscular hypertrophy and strength with the use of lower workloads (20--30% of one-repetition maximum or 1RM) and application of an elastic wrap/cuff proximal to an exercising muscle to occlude venous flow. It has been widely targeted as an advancing treatment in rehabilitation due to the positive effects on muscular strength and hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the body of knowledge of BFR and its use in a postoperative patient to increase strength and hypertrophy. Neuromuscular changes with regard to stability was also explored with the Star Balance Excursion Test (SEBT). Literature review. Literature to date has proven BFR valuable to increase muscle hypertrophy and strength in post-operative patients and geriatrics. Evidence has suggested that for healthy subjects, high load resistance training was still a more advantageous intervention. Exact causes for neuromuscular changes/results due to BFR have remained unknown. Case description. The patient was a 31-year-old male who had recently undergone a left hip arthroscopy with labral reconstruction. He had recently been discharged from the hospital with crutches but was significantly lacking left leg strength and stability. Outcomes. Increases in girth and neuromuscular control were noted in the BFR leg to a greater extent than the non-BFR leg. Discussion. The evidence relaying the use of BFR for increasing strength and hypertrophy in patients unable to withstand high loads is very valuable for physical therapists as rehabilitation experts. The evidence for use of the SEBT as an outcome measure for stability and neuromuscular control after BFR is also valuable and may prove effective for widespread use in the future.

Since the intensity of PA needed to effect cognition and cerebrovascular health remains unknown, we examined associations between PA and cognition, regional white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in older adults. Method: Forty-three older adults without cognitive impairment underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Waist-worn accelerometers objectively measured PA for approximately one week. Results: Higher time spent in moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) was uniquely associated with better memory and executive functioning after adjusting for all light PA. Higher MVPA was also uniquely associated with lower frontal WMH volume although the finding was no longer significant after additionally adjusting for age and accelerometer wear time. MVPA was not associated with CBF. Higher time spent in all light PA was uniquely associated with higher CBF but not with cognitive performance or WMH volume. Conclusions: Engaging in PA may be beneficial for cerebrovascular health, and MVPA in particular may help preserve memory and executive function in otherwise cognitively healthy older adults. There may be differential effects of engaging in lighter PA and MVPA on MRI markers of cerebrovascular health although this needs to be confirmed in future studies with larger samples. Future randomized controlled trials that increase PA are needed to elucidate cause-effect associations between PA and cerebrovascular health.

"Bannon, Sarah; Greenberg, Jonathan; Mace, Ryan A.; Locascio, Joseph J.; Vranceanu, Ana-Maria",The role of social isolation in physical and emotional outcomes among patients with chronic pain,"Objective: Social isolation negatively impacts early-disease processes and long-term health. Individuals with chronic pain are more vulnerable to social isolation, which exacerbates symptoms. It is currently unclear whether: 1. group-based programs for chronic pain improve social isolation, 2. improvements in social isolation account for improvements in outcomes. This study involved secondary data analysis of participants in a 10-week mind-body physical activity program. We examined whether social isolation improved during treatment, and whether such improvements accounted for improvements in emotional and physical functioning. Methods: Participants (N = 82) with chronic pain were randomized to a group-based mind-body physical activity intervention with ( GetActive-Fitbit; n = 41) or without a Fitbit device ( GetActive; n = 41). Participants completed self-reported measures of social isolation, emotional functioning (depression and anxiety symptoms), and multimodal physical functioning (self-report, performance-based, and objective). We used linear mixed effects modeling to examine pre-post treatment changes in social isolation and whether these changes accounted for improvements in emotional and physical functioning. Results: Both interventions were associated with significant and comparable improvements in social isolation from baseline to end of treatment, and improvements in social isolation accounted for significant improvements in self-reported emotional and physical functioning. Conclusion: Interventions may target social isolation in chronic pain to optimize treatment outcomes.

Road injuries incurred by people playing video games on mobile phones (or other media devices) while walking have also become a cause for concern. Pokémon Go has been the world's most popular game since it was launched in July 2016, with more than 15 million players trying to catch all Pokémon available in the game; however, the case detailed here is the first reported accident in the medical literature caused by a pedestrian distracted by the game while crossing a street. Objective: We aim to provide additional information on the innovative nature of distractions that generate risks in road-users, and to explore the underreporting of pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions due to mobile device usage. Methods: We included in this case report a 25-year-old male who suddenly crossed a road while playing Pokémon Go and was hit by a van, reporting several injuries and being assisted by the Emergency Medical Service of our hospital (Padova, Italy). The patient’s history, the circumstances in which the collision happened, imaging data, and clinical course information were recorded per our hospital’s privacy policy. Results: The patient hit by the van was playing Pokémon Go on his mobile phone while crossing a street, despite red traffic lights, which he did not notice due to of the distraction induced by the game. Conclusions: Mobile videogames that imply movement (ie, walking, running, cycling) to play are an effective way to improve physical activity practice, especially in adolescents and young adults. Nevertheless, cases like the one presented here point out that these games could pose a significant risk to users who play while walking, cycling, or driving in unsafe areas such as city streets, because players become distracted and may ignore surrounding hazards. Comprehensive, multilevel interventions are needed to reduce accidents caused by distraction, and to stress findings on the positive and negative effects of video games, which are becoming a source of public health concern. Health care providers should be aware of their chief role in these possible prevention strategies, based on their direct interactions with road incident victims.

In spite of that, large part of the population does not meet physical activity guidelines and many individuals live a sedentary life. Recent technological progresses and the widespread adoption of mobile technology, such as smartphone and wearables, have opened the way to the development of digital behaviour change interventions targeting physical activity promotion. Such interventions would greatly benefit from the inclusion of computational models framed on behaviour change theories and model-based reasoning. However, research on these topics is still at its infancy. The current paper presents a smartphone application and wearable device system called Muoviti! that targets physical activity promotion among adults not meeting the recommended physical activity guidelines. Specifically, we propose a computational model of behaviour change, grounded on the social cognitive theory of self-efficacy. The purpose of the computational model is to dynamically integrate information referring to individuals’ self-efficacy beliefs and physical activity behaviour in order to define exercising goals that adapt to individuals’ changes over time.The paper presents (i) the theoretical constructs that informed the development of the computational model, (ii) an overview of Muoviti! describing the system dynamics, the graphical user interface, the adopted measures and the intervention design, and (iii) the computational model based on Dynamic Decision Network.

"Barker, Ruth Nancy; Brauer, Sandra; Carson, Richard",Training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps to biceps activation during reaching tasks after chronic and severe stroke,"This exploratory study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms that contributed to improvements in upper limb function following a novel training program. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to examine training-induced changes in the pattern of triceps and biceps activation during reaching tasks in stroke survivors with severe paresis in the chronic stage of recovery. The EMG data were obtained in the context of a single blind randomised clinical trial conducted with 42 stroke survivors with minimal upper limb muscle activity and who were more than 6 months post-stroke. Of the 33 participants who completed the study, 10 received training of reaching using a non-robotic upper limb training device, the SMART Arm, with EMG triggered functional electrical stimulation (EMG-stim), 13 received training of reaching using the SMART Arm alone, and 10 received no intervention. Each intervention group engaged in 12 1-h training sessions over a 4-week period. Clinical and laboratory measures of upper limb function were administered prior to training (0 weeks), at completion (4 weeks) and 2 months (12 weeks) after training. The primary outcome measure was ‘upper arm function’ which is Item 6 of the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS). Laboratory measures consisted of two multijoint reaching tasks to assess ‘maximum isometric force’ and ‘maximum distance reached’. Surface EMG was used to monitor triceps brachii and biceps brachii during the two reaching tasks. To provide a comparison with normal values, seven healthy adults were tested on one of the reaching tasks according to the same procedure. Study findings demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in upper limb function for stroke participants in the two training groups compared to those who received no training however no difference was found between the two training groups. For the reaching tasks, all stroke participants, when compared to normal healthy adults, exhibited lower triceps and biceps activation and a lower ratio of triceps to biceps activation. Following training, stroke participants demonstrated increased triceps activation and an increased ratio of triceps to biceps activation for the task that was trained. Better performance was associated with greater triceps activation and a higher ratio of triceps to biceps activation. The findings suggest that increased activation of triceps as an agonist and an improved coordination between triceps and biceps could have mediated the observed changes in arm function. The changes in EMG activity were small relative to the changes in arm function indicating that factors, such as the contribution of other muscles of reaching, may also be implicated.

Behavioural change is one plausible explanation. This study investigated the behavioural effects of a mobile-phone based home telehealth (MTH) intervention in people with diabetes. It was hypothesized that MTH would improve self-efficacy, illness beliefs, and diabetes self-care. Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared standard care to standard care supplemented with MTH (self-monitoring, data transmission, graphical and nurse-initiated feedback, educational calls). Self-report measures of self-efficacy, illness beliefs, and self-care were repeated at baseline, three months, and nine months. MTH effects were based on the group by time interactions in hierarchical linear models and effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interviews with MTH participants explored the perceived effects of MTH on diabetes self-management. Results: Eighty-one participants were randomized to the intervention ( n = 45) and standard care ( n = 36). Significant group by time effects were observed for five out of seven self-efficacy subscales. Effect sizes were large, particularly at nine months. Interaction effects for illness beliefs and self-care were non-significant, but effect sizes and confidence intervals suggested MTH may positively affect diet and exercise. In interviews, MTH was associated with increased awareness, motivation, and a greater sense of security. Improved self-monitoring and diet were reported by some participants. Discussion: MTH empowers people with diabetes to manage their condition and may influence self-care. Future MTH research would benefit from investigating behavioural mechanisms and determining patient profiles predictive of greater behavioural effectiveness.

"Baruth, Meghan; Schlaff, Rebecca A.; Deere, Samantha; Walker, Jessica L.; Dressler, Brenna L.; Wagner, Sarah F.; Boggs, Ashley; Simon, Holly A.",The feasibility and efficacy of a behavioral intervention to promote appropriate gestational weight gain,"Introduction: Nearly half of all women gain above gestational weight gain (GWG) recommendations. This study assessed the feasibility and efficacy of a pilot behavioral intervention on GWG and physical activity behaviors. Methods: Women (n = 45) 14–20 weeks gestation enrolled in a behavioral intervention. Physicians ‘prescribed’ the intervention to low risk patients. The intervention included self-monitoring, support, and optional walking groups. Process evaluation measures regarding usage and acceptability of study components were obtained. Physical activity was objectively measured at baseline and 35 weeks. The percentage of participants with appropriate GWG was calculated. Control data was obtained from the same clinic where participants were recruited. Results: Overall, the intervention was acceptable to participants; attrition was low (6.7%), weekly contact was high (87%), and self-monitoring was high (Fitbit worn on 82% of intervention weeks; weekly weighing on 81%). Facebook (40% of weeks) and study website use (19%) was low, as was walking group attendance (7% attended a single group). Participants reported a lack of discussions about the study with their physician. Results showed no significant difference between intervention and control participants in the percentage who gained excess weight (p = 0.37). There was a significant decrease in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in intervention participants (p < 0.0001). Discussion: Continued efforts for promoting physical activity and appropriate GWG are needed. Although acceptable, the intervention was not efficacious. Trainings for, or input from prenatal healthcare providers on how to best encourage and support patients’ engagement in healthy behaviors, such as PA, are warranted.

"Batchelder, Sydney R.; Van Heukelom, Justin T.; Proctor, Kaitlyn; Washington, Wendy Donlin",Escalating schedules of incentives increase physical activity with no differences between deposit and no‐deposit groups: A systematic replication,"Physical inactivity has increasingly affected public health in the United States during the COVID‐19 pandemic as it is associated with chronic diseases such as arthritis, cancer, and heart disease. Contingency management has been shown to increase physical activity. Therefore, the present study sought to evaluate the effects of an escalating schedule of monetary reinforcement with a reset contingency on physical activity, as compared between 2 counterbalanced groups in which a monetary deposit of $25 was either required (deposit group) or not (no‐deposit group). Twenty‐five adults wore Fitbit accelerometers to monitor step counts. An ABA reversal design was used; in the 2 baseline phases, no programmed contingencies were in place for step counts. During intervention, step goals were set using a modified 70 th percentile schedule with a 7‐day window: Reaching the first goal would result in $0.25, and incentives increased by $0.25 for each subsequent day in which the goal was met. Failure to reach a goal resulted in a reset of the monetary incentive value to $0.25. Ten out of 12 participants from the deposit group were determined to be responders to intervention, whereas 8 out of 13 participants from the no‐deposit group were determined to be responders to intervention. Overall, there were no significant differences between the groups' step counts. However, the deposit group's intervention was cheaper to implement, which suggests that deposit contracts are a viable modification for physical activity interventions.

Physical Activity (PA) could be increased through changes in routine travel behaviour. Achieving a certain PA amount is essential in the secondary prevention of CHD patients. Objective: This study combines objective monitoring together with an intervention using advanced Information, Communication and Technology means in a framework to improve travel-related PA. This paper aims to describe an integrated research framework and tests the effectiveness of a theory-based (Trans-theoretical Model, TTM) intervention. Methods: A pilot Randomised Controlled Trial (70:30) was conducted in Belgium. Participating patients attended a preparatory work session intended to get their demographic information, assess their Stage of Change, and learn using a smartphone app (developed to monitor travel behaviour). After the work session, patients in the experimental group were monitored for three weeks and then received a customized feedback report. After feedback, the patients were monitored for another three weeks; while patients in the control arm were continuously monitored for 6 weeks without an intermediate feedback report. At the end of the study period, both groups received their feedback report. Results: The data of 25 patients were used in the trial, of which 18 were in the experimental group. The outcome measure used was the Active Travel Score (ATS), i.e. the PA achieved by walking and cycling trips. A significant ( p < 0.05) positive increase in ATS (X ﻿- = 14.2 , 95 % , CIs = 2.1—26.4 ) was observed after the intervention. Multiple pairwise comparisons confirmed that the effect of the intervention lasted for a week, indicating an important short-term effect. Conclusion: Objective monitoring and TTM-based interventions can be useful to provide a low-cost solution to achieve an increase in PA in secondary prevention of cardiac patients. Although these results are promising, RCTs with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the current findings.

"Bebetsos, E.; Zetou, E.; Vezos, N.",An exploratory study of self-efficacy and attitudes on self-care health behaviors among Greek Naval Academy cadets. An application of the Theory of Planned Behavior,"Many health conditions are caused by risk behaviors, such as problem drinking, substance use, and smoking. Health-compromising behaviors can be eliminated by self-regulatory efforts, and health-enhancing behaviors can be adopted instead, such as physical activity, weight control, and preventive nutrition. Literature review indicated the negative correlation between smoking and exercise, suggesting that smoking status has been positively associated with weight-loss intention, but negatively correlated with use of exercise. Additionally, smoking is negatively associated with readiness for participation in vigorous exercise. Research supports the fact that healthy diet can prevent and manage cardiovascular diseases and orthopaedic disorders. Facts indicate that if interventions foster exercise habits, this could facilitate transfer effects from one health behavior to the other. The aim of the study was to investigate the involvement of self-efficacy and attitudes on self-care health behaviors such as eating, smoking and exercise habits. The sample consisted of 185 cadets of the Greek Naval Academy (165 men, 20 women). They completed the Greek versions of the “Theory of Planned Behavior” and “Health Behavior” questionnaires. Results indicated that youngest cadets reported healthier habits than the older ones. More specifically, they were more positive oriented on eating healthier, and exercising, and more negatively oriented towards smoking. Overall, results shine for the first time some light on crucial and important aspects of prediction of intentions among healthy and unhealthy behaviors of military personnel.

"Beleigoli, Alline; Andrade, Andre Q.; Diniz, Maria De Fatima; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz",Personalized web-based weight loss behavior change program with and without dietitian online coaching for adults with overweight and obesity: Randomized controlled trial,"Background: The effect of computer- or human-delivered personalized feedback on the effectivess of web-based behavior change platforms for weight loss is unclear. Objective: We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a web-based behavior change intervention personalized through either computerized or human-delivered feedback with a nonpersonalized intervention in promoting weight loss in community-based adults with overweight or obesity. Methods: This pragmatic, 3-group, parallel-arm, randomized trial recruited students and staff in a Brazilian public university who were aged 18 to 60 years, had a BMI of ≥25 kg/m² , and were not pregnant. Participants were allocated to one of 3 groups: platform only (24-week behavior change program delivered using a web platform with personalized computer-delivered feedback), platform plus coaching (same 24-week web-based behavior change program plus 12 weeks of personalized feedback delivered online by a dietitian), or waiting list (nonpersonalized dietary and physical activity recommendations delivered through an e-booklet and videos). Self-reported weight at 24 weeks was the primary outcome. Changes in dietary and physical activity habits within 24 weeks were secondary outcomes. Results: Among the 1298 participants, 375 (28.89%) were lost to follow-up. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the platform-only and platform plus coaching groups had greater mean weight loss than the waiting-list group at 24 weeks (–1.08 kg, 95% CI –1.41 to –0.75 vs –1.57 kg, 95% CI –1.92 to –1.22 vs –0.66 kg, 95% CI –0.98 to –0.34, respectively). The platform-only and platform plus coaching groups, compared with the waiting list group, had a greater increase in the consumption of vegetables (3%, 95% CI 1% to 6% vs 5%, 95% CI 2% to 8% vs –3%, 95% CI –5% to 0%) and fruits (9%, 95% CI 6% to 12% vs 6%, 95% CI 2% to 9% vs 2%, 95% CI 0% to 6%) and a larger reduction in ultraprocessed food intake (–18%, 95% CI –23% to –13% vs –25%, 95% CI –30% to –20% vs –12%, 95% CI –16% to –8%). Changes in physical activity did not differ across the groups. Engagement was higher in the platform plus coaching group than in the platform-only group (7.6 vs 5.2 completed sessions; P=.007). Longer usage of the platform was associated with clinically meaningful (≥5%) weight loss (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04). Conclusions: The web-based behavior change programs with computer- and human-delivered personalized feedback led to greater, albeit small-magnitude, weight loss within 24 weeks. Improvement in multiple dietary habits, but not physical activity, were also greater in the personalized programs compared with the nonpersonalized one. The human-delivered personalized feedback by the online dietitian coach increased user engagement with the program and was associated with a significantly higher chance of clinically meaningful weight loss.

"Belling, Patrick K.; Suss, Joel; Ward, Paul","Advancing theory and application of cognitive research in sport: Using representative tasks to explain and predict skilled anticipation, decision-making, and option-generation behavior","Objectives: Three main goals were addressed in this research. First, we tested the claims of two cognitive mechanisms that have been proposed to explain expert performance. This was done during assessment and intervention phases of decision making. Second, we tested the validity of an online test of perceptual-cognitive skill in soccer: The Online Assessment of Strategic Skill In Soccer (OASSIS). Third, we compared the OASSIS to other predictors of skill in soccer. Design: Over the course of a three-part experiment, participants completed an updated version of the option-generation paradigm employed by Ward, Ericsson, and Williams (2013), the OASSIS, and a battery of other cognitive tests. Performance on these tests was used to inform theory and validate the OASSIS as an applied tool for domain professionals. Methods: NCAA Division 1 and recreational-level soccer players completed a battery of tests, both using paper/pencil (see Ward et al., 2013) and online. Results: Support for Long Term Working Memory theory (LTWM; see Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995) was observed during both phases of decision making, though the prescriptions of the Take-The-First heuristic (see Johnson & Raab, 2003) tend to hold, particularly within intervention phase. When used to predict skill-group membership, the OASSIS accounted for more variance than domain-general tests of cognition. Furthermore, scores on the OASSIS correlated with other measures of perceptual-cognitive skill in soccer and the process-level predictions made by LTWM. Conclusions: Updates to our theoretical understanding of expert performance are provided and the validity of the OASSIS is demonstrated.

A 4-week intervention managed through an Instagram™ account was designed to promote more harmonious passion and less obsessive passion, as well as more positive emotions and less negative emotions related to participants’ favorite exercise activities. A web-based questionnaire was distributed to 518 young adults (mean age 26.5) before and after the intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( N = 226) or control group ( N = 292). The intervention did not predict change in passion for the activity. However, the intervention predicted more positive emotional outcomes from the activity, statistically controlled for emotions reported at baseline and negative emotions reported at follow-up. Results indicate that digital platforms may be relevant in promoting more physical activity in the population, through the facilitation of more positive emotions related to exercise.

"Bergström, Helena",Health promotion for adults with intellectual disabilities: Evaluation of a multi-component intervention in community residences,"People with intellectual disabilities (ID) have an increased risk for ill-health, partly due to low physical activity and an unbalanced diet. Caregivers who support adults living in community residences face a dilemma when trying to support healthy behaviours without encroaching on autonomy. The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effects of a novel health intervention directed at both staff and residents in community residences for people with ID and to describe and analyse barriers and facilitators in the implementation process.An intervention was developed to promote physical activity and healthy diet among adults with ID in community residences. According to Social Cognitive Theory, behaviour, personal factors and environmental factors all interact. Therefore, the intervention entailed both strengthening the individual and influencing the social and physical context. The intervention comprised three components: 1) the appointment of a health ambassador; 2) a study circle for caregivers; and 3) a health course for residents.The intervention study was designed as a cluster randomised controlled trial including 30 residences and 130 individuals. The primary outcome was physical activity, measured through pedometry. Secondary outcomes were dietary quality measured through digital photography, BMI, waist circumference, satisfaction with life assessed on a scale and residence health promotion work routines assessed with a questionnaire. Outcomes were related to intervention fidelity. A separate study was conducted to develop and evaluate the scale used to assess satisfaction with life. To study barriers and facilitators in health education for adults with ID, data were collected through evaluation notes, observations and a group discussion with course leaders. To study the implementation process, interviews were conducted with managers and health ambassadors.A positive intervention effect was found on physical activity, with an average increase of 1.608 steps/day among participants in the intervention group (P = 0.045). A positive intervention effect was also found on work routines, with an average increase of 7.1 percentage points on a self-assessment scale among residences in the intervention group (P = 0.016). No significant effects were found on dietary quality, BMI, waist circumference or satisfaction with life. The qualitative studies suggested that it is important to support motivation for change during the process and to support the residents not only within the health course, but also within the social and physical context.Even greater effects might be achieved by improving the implementation strategies and the dietary aspect of the intervention. In order to maintain the positive effects in the long term, sustaining procedures must be established and issues regarding health promotion and empowerment should be continuously discussed among caregivers as well as at a management level.

The statistical analysis involved tests of comparison and association. Results: In general, at the first point, the participants in the two groups were predisposed to make changes in what they ate and in their physical activity. However, significant difference was only observed in relation to weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-hip ratio and readiness for change among the members of the intervention group.

Because many students do not receive treatment due to lack of access on university campuses, mobile‐health (mHealth) adaptations of evidence‐based treatments represent an opportunity to increase treatment accessibility and engagement. The purpose of this study was to test the initial efficacy of Building Healthy Eating and Self‐Esteem Together for University Students (BEST‐U), which is a 10‐week mHealth self‐guided cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT‐gsh) app that is paired with a brief 25–30‐min weekly telehealth coaching, for reducing ED psychopathology in university students. Method A non‐concurrent multiple‐baseline design (N = 8) was used to test the efficacy of BEST‐U for reducing total ED psychopathology (primary outcome), ED‐related behaviors and cognitions (secondary outcomes), and ED‐related clinical impairment (secondary outcome). Data were examined using visual analysis and Tau‐BC effect‐size calculations. Results BEST‐U significantly reduced total ED psychopathology and binge eating, excessive exercise, and restriction (effect sizes ranged from −0.39 to −0.92). Although body dissatisfaction decreased, it was not significant. There were insufficient numbers of participants engaging in purging to evaluate purging outcomes. Clinical impairment significantly reduced from pre‐to‐post‐treatment. Discussion The current study provided initial evidence that BEST‐U is a potentially efficacious treatment for reducing ED symptoms and ED‐related clinical impairment. Although larger‐scale randomized controlled trials are needed, BEST‐U may represent an innovative, scalable tool that could reach greater numbers of underserved university students than traditional intervention‐delivery models.

Offering transdiagnostic, web-based prevention programs such as ICare Prevent to those with subclinical complaints has the potential to reduce some barriers to receiving help (eg, availability of services, privacy considerations, and students’ desire for autonomy). However, uptake of these interventions is often low, and accounts of recruitment challenges are needed to complement available effectiveness research in student populations. Objective: The aims of this study were to describe recruitment challenges together with effective recruitment strategies for ICare Prevent and provide basic information on the intervention’s effectiveness. Methods: A 3-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in a student sample with subclinical symptoms of depression and anxiety on the effectiveness of an individually guided (human support and feedback on exercises provided after each session, tailored to each participant) and automatically guided (computer-generated messages provided after each session, geared toward motivation) version of ICare Prevent, a web-based intervention with transdiagnostic components for the indicated prevention of depression and anxiety. The intervention was compared with care as usual. Descriptive statistics were used to outline recruitment challenges and effective web-based and offline strategies as well as students’use of the intervention. A basic analysis of intervention effects was conducted using a Bayesian linear mixed model, with Bayes factors reported as the effect size. Results: Direct recruitment through students’ email addresses via the central student administration was the most effective strategy. Data from 35 participants were analyzed (individually guided: n = 14, 40%; automatically guided: n = 8, 23%; care as usual: n = 13, 37%). Use of the intervention was low, with an average of 3 out of 7 sessions (SD 2.9) completed. The analyses did not suggest any intervention effects other than anecdotal evidence (all Bayes factors₁₀ ≤ 2.7). Conclusions: This report adds to the existing literature on recruitment challenges specific to the student population. Testing the feasibility of recruitment measures and the greater involvement of the target population in their design, as well as shifting from direct to indirect prevention, can potentially help future studies in the field. In addition, this report demonstrates an alternative basic analytical strategy for underpowered randomized controlled trials.

Although the BWL group achieved greater weight loss (mean [95% CI] in kilograms) than the ME group at posttreatment (−3.8 [−2.5 to −5.0] vs. + 0.9 [−0.4 to 2.2], P < 0.001) and follow‐up (−3.2 [−2.0 to −4.5] vs. + 1.1 [−0.2 to 2.4], P < 0.001), there were no significant group (BWL vs. ME) differences (mean [95% CI]) in migraine days per month at posttreatment (−3.0 [−2.0 to −4.0] vs. −4.0 [−2.9 to −5.0], P = 0.185) or follow‐up (−3.8 [−2.7 to −4.8] vs. −4.4 [−3.4 to −5.5], P = 0.378). Conclusions: Contrary to hypotheses, BWL and ME yielded similar, sustained reductions in migraine headaches. Future research should evaluate whether adding BWL to standard pharmacological and/or nonpharmacological migraine treatment approaches yields greater benefits.

"Bond, Dale S.; Thomas, J. Graham; O'Leary, Kevin C.; Lipton, Richard B.; Peterlin, B. Lee; Roth, Julie; Rathier, Lucille; Wing, Rena R.",Objectively measured physical activity in obese women with and without migraine,"Aim: The aim of this article is to cross-sectionally compare objectively measured physical activity (PA) levels and their association with migraine characteristics in obese women with and without migraine. Methods: Obese women seeking weight loss treatment were divided into migraine ( n = 25) and control ( n = 25) groups matched by age and body mass index (BMI). Participants wore the SenseWear Armband monitor for seven days to objectively evaluate daily light-(LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA). Migraine diagnosis was confirmed by a neurologist using ICHD-3-beta criteria. Migraine characteristics were tracked daily using a smartphone-based diary over a four-week period immediately preceding the objective PA assessment. Results: Migraine participants spent 57.9 fewer minutes/day in LPA (141.1 ± 56.4 vs. 199.1 ± 87.7, p = 0.019) and 24.5 fewer minutes/day in MVPA (27.8 ± 17.0 vs. 52.3 ± 26.0, p < 0.001), compared to controls. Migraine participants reported 4.8 ± 3.1 migraine days/month (mean duration = 17.1 ± 8.9 hours; mean maximum pain severity = 6.4 ± 1.7 on a 0–10 scale). Higher BMI ( p < 0.05), but not migraine characteristics, were related to lower total PA. Additionally, total objectively measured PA was not associated with how often PA was reported to exacerbate migraine attacks during the four-week diary assessment. Conclusions: Obese women with migraine spent nearly 1.5 hours/day less in PA compared to controls; however, lower PA was not related to migraine characteristics. Further research is needed to identify PA barriers and effective interventions in obese women with migraine.

"Bonnevie, Erika; Rosenberg, Sarah D.; Goldbarg, Jaclyn; Ashley-West, Atalie; Smyser, Joe",Building strong futures: The feasibility of using a targeted digital media campaign to improve knowledge about pregnancy and low birthweight among Black women,"Objective: Low birthweight is one of the main causes of poor health outcomes among newborns, with Black women having a disproportionately high prevalence. A digital intervention targeted Black women in Orange County, Florida with information on positive pregnancy-related knowledge and attitudes related to low birthweight. This paper reports on campaign methods for the first 2.5 years of implementation. Methods: Campaign content was tailored toward Black women, around a reproductive empowerment lens. Content focused on emphasizing healthy pregnancy-related behaviors and creating positive representations of Black women throughout the various stages of pregnancy through both static images and a web series. Digital metrics gauged campaign engagement. Three cross-sectional online surveys conducted in the intervention county examined Black women’s pregnancy-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Results: After two years of campaign implementation, social media accounts showed 1784 followers. While Facebook showed more average monthly impressions, Instagram showed more average monthly engagements. Survey results showed some increases in knowledge about prenatal care, weight gain, exercise, and the health impacts of low birthweight. Conclusions for Practice: This study highlights the potential for a culturally-appropriate digital intervention to promote positive pregnancy outcomes among at-risk women. Digital interventions offer a potential way to achieve positive pregnancy-related behavior changes on a larger scale. This may be particularly important given that the COVID-19 pandemic may be changing the ways that pregnant women access information. Studies should examine the impact and feasibility of using culturally-appropriate digital interventions that directly address Black women and their specific experiences during pregnancy.

"Books, Gregory J.; Klemm, Kurt",A unique approach to preventing back pain in the dental office,"Back pain has been reported by a majority of dental practitioners for decades. Efforts to relieve pain have focused on postural modification, exercise, and equipment designed to facilitate “neutral” posture, but there has been no significant reduction in reported rates of pain. By focusing on static muscle activity and muscle overuse rather than posture, the authors describe the theory behind an innovative approach for the development of an ergonomic intervention. Objective: Demonstrate that posture is not the problem. Participants: none. Methods: Critical analysis of existing literature in dentistry and in other more advanced fields. Results: Application of current research outside of dentistry. Conclusions: Elimination of Static Muscle Activity rather than modification of posture is the critical issue in preventing pain,fatigue, and injury.

Methods: This randomized controlled trial was performed in participants with prediabetes. Participants were recruited from a primary care unit. Allocation to the study groups used a stratified block randomization. All participants received physical activity education at baseline. The intervention group additionally received supportive text messages by using mobile phone text messages. Participants were assessed at baseline at 8 and 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was physical activity energy. Secondary outcomes included weight, body mass index, waist circumstance, and blood pressure. Results: All participants were included in the analyses ( n = 324; control: n = 162; intervention: n = 162). Mean physical activity energy was significantly increased in those who received text messages at 8 weeks, increasing 1,590.73 Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks (METs)/min/week (95% confidence interval [CI]: 837.72, 2343.75) in the intervention group and 407.39 METs/min/weeks (95% CI: −267.59, 1082.36) in the control group with an adjusted mean difference of −1,183 METs/min/weeks (95% CI: −2190.11, −176.58, p = 0.02). Over the 12 weeks follow-up period, mean physical activity energy did not differ statistically by group. Mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of the total physical energy revealed no significant differences, with an adjusted mean difference 273.3 METs/min/week (95% CI: −530.64, 1077.21, p = 0.513). However, moderate physical energy was significantly increased to 256.40 METs/min/week (95% CI: 17.20, 495.63, p = 0.040). Conclusion: Text messaging significant in physical activity at the 8-week. But, text messaging no significant in physical activity at 12-week. Further research is needed to identify optimal times to send messages to people with prediabetes.

"Bopp, Melissa; Sims, Dangaia; Matthews, Stephen A.; Rovniak, Liza S.; Poole, Erika; Colgan, Joanna","Development, implementation, and evaluation of Active Lions: A campaign to promote active travel to a university campus","Purpose: To outline the development, implementation, and evaluation of a multistrategy intervention to promote active transportation, on a large university campus. Design: Single group pilot study. Setting: A large university in the Northeastern United States. Participants: University students (n = 563), faculty and staff (employees, n = 999) were included in the study. Intervention: The Active Lions campaign aimed to increase active transportation to campus for all students and employees. The campaign targeted active transport participation through the development of a smartphone application and the implementation of supporting social marketing and social media components. Measures: Component-specific measures included app user statistics, social media engagement, and reach of social marketing strategies. Overall evaluation included cross-sectional online surveys preintervention and postintervention of student and employee travel patterns and campaign awareness. Analysis: Number of active trips to campus were summed, and the percentage of trips as active was calculated. T tests compared the differences in outcomes from preintervention to postintervention. Results: Students had a higher percentage of active trips postintervention (64.2%) than preintervention (49.2%; t = 3.32, P = .001), although there were no differences for employees (7.9% and 8.91%). Greater awareness of Active Lions was associated with greater active travel. Conclusion: This multistrategy approach to increase active transportation on a college campus provided insight on the process of developing and implementing a campaign with the potential for impacting health behaviors among campus members.

The Mars-500 project was an isolation and confinement experiment for identifying problems and solutions related to spaceflights missions. Medical countermeasures, such as physical exercise for ‘bone degradation’ are well recognized, but it is also important to develop psychological countermeasures for a possible ‘psychological degradation’. Clinical Psychology has techniques useful for treating psychological problems, recent advances in Positive Psychology open up new possibilities for promoting resilience, and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have proven their utility for enhancing psychological treatments. In this work we describe EARTH, an ICT based application which includes psychological strategies self-delivered using a computerized program, and present the results obtained with the six astronauts who took part in the Mars-500 experiment. The results show that EARTH seems to be useful for inducing positive moods. Structured psychological countermeasures can be useful in spaceflight missions, even for resilient populations.

One potential health behavior intervention that has been shown to be effective for improving mental health is exercise, which may be facilitated by taking advantage of mobile application (app) technologies. Objective: To determine the extent to which a 12-week app-based exercise intervention can reduce depressive symptoms, burnout, and absenteeism in HCWs, compared with a wait list control condition. Design, setting, and participants: A 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted, with participants screened from April 6 to July 4, 2022. Participants were recruited from an urban health care organization in British Columbia, Canada. Participants completed measures before randomization and every 2 weeks thereafter. Interventions: Exercise condition participants were asked to complete four 20-minute sessions per week using a suite of body weight interval training, yoga, barre, and running apps. Wait-listed control participants received the apps at the end of the trial. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome consisted of the between-group difference in depressive symptoms measured with the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes corresponded to 3 subfacets of burnout (cynicism, emotional exhaustion, and professional efficacy) and absenteeism. Intention-to-treat analyses were completed with multilevel structural equation modeling, and Feingold effect sizes (ES) were estimated every 2 weeks. Results: A total of 288 participants (mean [SD] age, 41.0 [10.8] years; 246 [85.4%] women) were randomized to either exercise (n = 142) or wait list control (n = 146) conditions. Results revealed that ESs for depressive symptoms were in the small to medium range by trial's end (week 12, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.13]). Significant and consistent treatment effects were revealed for 2 facets of burnout, namely cynicism (week 12 ES, -0.33 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.13]) and emotional exhaustion (week 12 ES, -0.39 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.14]), as well as absenteeism ( r = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.03-0.26]). Adherence to the 80 minutes per week of exercise decreased from 78 (54.9%) to 33 (23.2%) participants between weeks 2 and 12. Conclusions and relevance: Although exercise was able to reduce depressive symptoms among HCWs, adherence was low toward the end of the trial. Optimizing adherence to exercise programming represents an important challenge to help maintain improvements in mental health among HCWs.

Methods: A Discrete Choice Experiment was used to quantify patients' preferences for the delivery of CR. This survey-based method elicited the relative importance of different characteristics of a program. Results: 200 in-patients eligible to attend CR completed the survey. Over half of the patients strongly preferred a centre-based compared to a home-based program. Many but not all preferred a program starting within two rather than six weeks of discharge and exercise delivered in a group rather than individual setting, with exercise via the internet using telehealth strongly disliked. Some respondents preferred lifestyle information delivered one-to-one by a health professional, and there was an overall preference against delivery by smart phone Apps. Some preferred a program out of rather than within working hours and a shorter program (four weeks compared to eight weeks). Conclusions: This study provides further insight into patient preferences for a CR program. Although the strongest preferences were for centre-based programs with healthcare professionals facilitating exercise classes and one-on-one education, it is important to offer flexible delivery as one approach will not suit everyone. Practice Implications: There is the potential to improve CR programs by focusing on patient preferences.

"Brindal, Emily; Hendrie, Gilly; Freyne, Jill; Coombe, Mac; Berkovsky, Shlomo; Noakes, Manny",Design and pilot results of a mobile phone weight-loss application for women starting a meal replacement programme,"We developed and tested a mobile phone application (app) to support individuals embarking on a partial meal replacement programme (MRP). Overweight or obese women were randomly allocated to one of two study groups. The intervention group received an MRP Support app. The control group received a static app based on the information available with the MRP. A total of 58 adult women (Support n = 28; Control n = 30) participated in the 8-week trial. Their BMI was 26–43 kg/m². Usage data suggested that the intervention group were more engaged with using the app throughout the study period. Mixed modelling revealed that the difference in weight loss between the intervention and control groups (estimated mean, EM = 3.2% and 2.2% respectively) was not significant ( P = 0.08). Objective data suggested that users of the Support app were more engaged than those using the control app. A total of 1098 prompts (54%) asking people in the intervention group to enter their meals were completed prior to the evening prompt. Women in the intervention group reported a greater increase in positive affect (i.e. mood) than those in the control group (EM = 0.48 and −0.01, respectively) ( P = 0.012). At Week 8, those in the control group reported a greater decrease in the effort they were willing to put into staying on the diet than those who received the Support app (EM = −2.8 and −1.4, respectively) ( P = 0.024). The Support app could be a useful adjunct to existing MRPs for psychological outcomes.

"Brogly, Christopher",Observations of positive mental health indicators in undergraduates using specialized mobile apps during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This dissertation presents findings from three longitudinal studies examining indicators of positive undergraduate mental health primarily during COVID-19 pandemic conditions at a large, residential, urban university in Canada (Western University) using apps with personal sensing data collection capabilities (e.g. GPS, step counts) over March 2019-August 2021. The apps featured mental health-related questionnaires – responses were representative of psychosocial outcomes for participants. Personal sensing data were representative of participant behavior/lifestyle. Questionnaires and personal sensing data were collected at the same time; personal sensing data was also collected hourly in the background for the final two studies. Associations between psychosocial outcomes and behavior/lifestyle found via mixed linear modelling revealed indicators of positive mental health. The first study, Smart Healthy Campus 1.0, began March 2019, concluding with limited data when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic; possible associations were identified. Initial plans were to improve SHC 1.0 with an upgraded SHC 2.0 study, but the Student Pandemic Experience (SPE) study was launched first, with questionnaires more fixated on pandemic conditions. Following this, SHC 2.0 was also launched shortly after, still relevant, although using shorter generic questionnaires. SPE completed with 315 participants who were primarily female (76%) iOS users (85.3%). Data collected for 40 weeks (11/2020 – 09/2021) included 4851 questionnaire responses and 25985 sensor samples with up to 68 individual values per sample. Mixed linear models were fit relating 15 mobile device (phone or tablet) sensors (e.g. step count) to 12 mental health-related questionnaire scores. SHC 2.0 ran with 94 participants were who primarily male (76.6%) iOS users (86%). Data collected for 30 weeks (01/2021 – 08/2021) included 1722 questionnaire responses and 6518 sensor samples with up to 68 individual values per sample. Mixed linear models were fit relating 12 mobile device (phone or tablet) sensors (e.g. step count) to the SHC 2.0 questionnaires. From these studies, it was found that device sensors had statistically significant associations with the selected mental health-related questionnaires for undergraduates during a major pandemic. These findings suggest directions for mental health-related programs (e.g. apps or physical activity) and interventions during a pandemic for a comparable group and setting.

Materials and Methods: The self-administered, short version of the 7-day recall, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, was adapted to develop the “Physical Activity and Pokémon Go questionnaire,” which was distributed using social media. Four weeks after the launch of the application, 461 participants ( n = 193 male, n = 265 female, n = 3 transgender) had completed the questionnaire. At 3-month follow-up, 127 participants repeated the questionnaire. Results: At baseline, mixed models analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed main effects for Pokémon Go users versus nonusers in the amount of days of vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity, and walking (All P < 0.01). Users reported that they undertook less days of vigorous physical activity than nonusers, but more days of moderate physical activity and walking. There were no differences in body mass index, minutes of vigorous or moderate physical activity, and walking, or sitting on weekdays (All P > 0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA identified increased sitting on weekdays ( P < 0.05), but maintained vigorous, moderate and walking physical activity behaviors in users who remained users. Conclusion: Pokémon Go use can increase the frequency of days of physical activity benefitting health. Users at both time points maintained their physical activity behaviour, but increased sitting time on weekdays, highlighting that another intervention to prevent sitting is needed.

"Bruna-Lewis, Sean Patrick","""Sowing seeds for the future with Tigua history and tradition"": Diabetes prevention and management at Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo","This dissertation examines type 2 diabetes management and prevention at Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, a federally recognized American Indian tribe in El Paso, Texas. Type 2 diabetes is a serious and growing concern at the Pueblo, and while the incidence is not as high as it is in other tribes in the United States, it is still much higher than the national average. Despite excellent biomedical research that shows how individuals can prevent diabetes, and countless translated diabetes prevention programs targeted to individuals and families to prevent the disease, the incidence of diabetes continues to rise. This dissertation argues that there are currently two dominant models, and one emerging model, of diabetes research and intervention among American Indian peoples. Located on a spectrum, they are (1) individual-oriented biomedical models developed predominately for white, Western populations, which are applied to both the general U.S. population and American Indian peoples; (2) modifications, adaptations, or translations of these programs for application in non-white communities, including American Indian communities; and (3) emerging models of communal prevention in which intervention activities derive from local cultural practices and are then enhanced with biomedical practices. I argue that diabetes research will benefit by shifting to the third model of care and prevention. Utilizing a collaborative methodology founded on community-based participatory research, I conducted 18 months of fieldwork and volunteer employment at a community health center and the reservation it serves. During research, I observed or participated in secular activities at the Community Health Center, religious activities as part of the annual religious cycle, and a variety of activities related to experimental community gardens. I enhanced my participant-observation with interviews of the Community Health Center staff (both native and non-native), of tribal council members and religious leaders, of enrolled diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, and of non-diabetic tribal descendants. This research covers four intersecting domains to shed light on the occurrence of diabetes and changing methods of prevention. The first domain, a political economic history of the Pueblo, shows how type 2 diabetes took hold in the community after changes in economies, diet, and exercise. Five epochs are explored: (1) the Pueblo's dislocation to their current location following the Pueblo Revolt and the resulting impact on lifestyle; (2) how loss of tribal land changed food production practices and introduced new foods; (3) how federal recognition had both positive and negative impacts on the Pueblo's built environment, resulting in new dance practices and food consumption; (4) how a ""boom and bust"" era of casino gaming negatively impacted wellness programs; and (5) how the Pueblo is reshaping diabetes prevention by supporting nation building programs and tribal identity. The second domain examines diabetes-related practices at the Community Health Center. I learned that the Community Health Center is engaged in management of diabetes at the individual level but has yet to establish activities that may prevent diabetes in the reservation. This inability to expand is the result of structural practices that make it very difficult for the Pueblo to develop new programs. Structural challenges include insufficient staff, lack of training in new and innovative health prevention models, and a system that promotes Western medical practices and minimizes the contribution of the local American Indian staff. In contrast to the Community Health Center, the third domain, the broader Pueblo community, reveals that Pueblo members do participate in many community-wide practices that may prove useful for diabetes prevention. Although the tribal community does not view these activities as wellness practices, if these activities were supporte… (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)",2014,,1
"Bruton, Adam M.; Shearer, David A.; Mellalieu, Stephen D.",Who said “there is no ‘I’ in team”? The effects of observational learning content level on efficacy beliefs in groups,"Objectives: To investigate the effects of individual-level observational learning (OL INDV), team-level observational learning (OL TEAM), and multi-level observational learning (OL MULTI) on efficacy beliefs, task cohesion, and performance across three studies in sports teams. Design: Cross-sectional, experimental and single-case designs were employed across the three studies, respectively. Method: Study 1 used a cross-sectional design to explore the predictive relationship between OL INDV and OL TEAM use, and collective efficacy and task cohesion in 210 team sports athletes. Study 2 used a repeated-measures experimental design to compare effects of OL INDV versus OL TEAM interventions on collective and self-efficacy in two soccer teams. Study 3 used a single-case A-A-B-B design to assess the effectiveness of OL MULTI interventions on self-efficacy, collective efficacy, task cohesion and performance in an elite age-grade rugby union team across a competitive season. Results: In study 1, both OL INDV and OL TEAM use predicted collective efficacy, but only OL TEAM use predicted task dimensions of cohesion. In study 2, collective efficacy increased for both the OLINDV and OL TEAM interventions while self-efficacy increased only for the OL INDV intervention. In study 3, visual and effect size analyses indicated increased self-efficacy, collective efficacy task cohesion, and performance for the team during the off- and in-season intervention phases where the OLMULTI interventions were administered alongside usual sporting involvement (training sessions and/or competitive fixtures). Conclusions: The novel findings of this investigation show that OL INDV, OL TEAM and OL MULTI interventions can enhance efficacy beliefs in practical contexts and warrant application in groups across domains.

"Buchmann, Jana; Baumann, Nicola; Meng, Karin; Semrau, Jana; Kuhl, Julius; Pfeifer, Klaus; Kazén, Miguel; Vogel, Heiner; Faller, Hermann",Endurance and avoidance response patterns in pain patients: Application of action control theory in pain research,"Background: Identifying pain-related response patterns and understanding functional mechanisms of symptom formation and recovery are important for improving treatment. Objectives: We aimed to replicate pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns associated with the Fear-Avoidance Model, and its extension, the Avoidance-Endurance Model, and examined their differences in secondary measures of stress, action control (i.e., dispositional action vs. state orientation), coping, and health. Methods: Latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted on self-report data from 536 patients with chronic non-specific low back pain at the beginning of an inpatient rehabilitation program. Measures of stress (i.e., pain, life stress) and action control were analyzed as covariates regarding their influence on the formation of different pain response profiles. Measures of coping and health were examined as dependent variables. Results: Partially in line with our assumptions, we found three pain response profiles of distress-avoidance, eustress-endurance, and low-endurance responses that are depending on the level of perceived stress and action control. Distress-avoidance responders emerged as the most burdened, dysfunctional patient group concerning measures of stress, action control, maladaptive coping, and health. Eustress-endurance responders showed one of the highest levels of action versus state orientation, as well as the highest levels of adaptive coping and physical activity. Low-endurance responders reported lower levels of stress as well as equa levels of action versus state orientation, maladaptive coping, and health compared to eustress-endurance responders; however, equally low levels of adaptive coping and physical activity compared to distress-avoidance responders. Conclusions: Apart from the partially supported assumptions of the Fear-Avoidance and Avoidance-Endurance Model, perceived stress and dispositional action versus state orientation may play a crucial role in the formation of pain-related avoidance-endurance response patterns that vary in degree of adaptiveness. Results suggest tailoring interventions based on behavioral and functional analysis of pain responses in order to more effectively improve patients quality of life.

"Buckley, Edward J., III",Text message reminders and group fitness attendance,"Increasing physical activity (PA) has been established as a protective factor against several chronic diseases, yet sedentary lifestyles remain a problem. Currently 52% of American adults are not reaching the recommended levels of PA, helping motivate the public to engage in more PA remains a problem. Given the high adoption rates of mobile phones, and text messages (SMS), there is a growing number of interventions increasing PA through mobile phones, specifically text message campaigns. The potential of using group fitness classes to increase exercise adherence paired with text message reminders could serve as a viable intervention. The single subject experimental design (SSED) followed 8 participants (n=8) during 11 consecutive cycles of five-day periods. Participants were selected on first-come basis after sending an e-mailed to local employers seeking participants. Participants were ages 22 to 54 (M=31.63, SD= 10.29) primarily female (one male) working centered circa the downtown Gainesville area, had engaged in exercise the previous month between two and six times. Before the study began, participants selected five group fitness classes as weekly goals. Participant were measured on gym visits, goal fitness classes attended, and minutes spent at the gym. After establishing a baseline, participants received text message fitness reminders on days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle. The participants' data were analyzed using visual interpretation of the graphs and the 2 standard deviation (2SD) band method. None of the participants had statistically significant increases in class attendance, gym visits, or time at gym during the study. However, participants did demonstrate temporary increases or stabilizing practical effects from the text reminders particularly in gym visits and time spent at the gym. The non-tailored text reminders appeared to have no lasting effects on the behaviors, it beg the discussion of low-activity users who often revert back to little to no usage within a month being temporarily affected and how text message campaigns can help stabilize them during the first month of a new fitness campaign. This question to health promotion practitioners is simply giving a gym membership and basic communication is enough to cause lasting, meaningful change.

"Buis, Lorraine R.; Hirzel, Lindsey; Turske, Scott A.; Des Jardins, Terrisca R.; Yarandi, Hossein; Bondurant, Patricia",Use of a text message program to raise type 2 diabetes risk awareness and promote health behavior change (part I): Assessment of participant reach and adoption,"Background: There are an estimated 25.8 million American children and adults, equivalent to 8.3% of the US population, living with diabetes. Diabetes is particularly burdensome on minority populations. The use of mobile technologies for reaching broad populations is a promising approach, given its wide footprint and ability to deliver inexpensive personalized messages, to increase awareness of type 2 diabetes and promote behavior changes targeting risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes. As a part of the Beacon Community Cooperative Agreement Program, txt4health, a public-facing mobile health information service, was launched in 3 Beacon Communities: the Southeast Michigan Beacon Community in Detroit, MI, the Greater Cincinnati Beacon Community in Cincinnati, OH, and the Crescent City Beacon Community in New Orleans, LA. Txt4health is a mobile health information service designed to help people understand their risk for type 2 diabetes and become more informed about the steps they can take to lead healthy lives. Objective: The purpose of this investigation was to use the RE-AIM framework to document txt4health reach and adoption by focusing on enrollment and participant engagement in program pilots in Southeast Michigan and Greater Cincinnati. Methods: We conducted a retrospective records analysis of individual-level txt4health system data from participants in Southeast Michigan and Greater Cincinnati to determine participant usage of txt4health and engagement with the program. Results: Results from the retrospective records analysis revealed that 5570 participants initiated the 2-step enrollment process via 1 of 3 enrollment strategies: text message, website, or directly with Beacon staff who signed participants up via the website. In total, 33.00% (1838/5570) of participants completed the 2-step enrollment process and were fully enrolled in the program. All participants (100.00%, 1620/1620) who enrolled via text message completed the entire 2-step enrollment process versus 5.52% (218/3950) of participants who enrolled via website or a Beacon staff member. Of those who fully enrolled, 71.00% (1305/1838) completed the diabetes risk assessment and 74.27% (1365/1838) set an initial weight loss goal. Overall, 39.06% (718/1838) of participants completed all 14 weeks of the program and 56.26% (1034/1838) dropped out before completing all 14 weeks, with the bulk of dropouts occurring in the first 4 weeks. Length of participation varied greatly, ranging from 0-48.7 weeks (median 8.6, mean 15.8, SD 15.8). Wide variability of participant engagement in regards to weekly weight and physical activity was documented. Conclusions: Although broadly focused public health text message interventions may have the potential to reach large populations and show high levels of engagement among some users, the level of individual engagement among participants varies widely, suggesting that this type of approach may not be appropriate for all.

"Burg, Matthew M.; Schwartz, Joseph E.; Kronish, Ian M.; Diaz, Keith M.; Alcantara, Carmela; Duer-Hefele, Joan; Davidson, Karina W.",Does stress result in you exercising less? Or does exercising result in you being less stressed? Or is it both? Testing the bi-directional stress-exercise association at the group and person (N of 1) level,"Background: Psychosocial stress contributes to heart disease in part by adversely affecting maintenance of health behaviors, while exercise can reduce stress. Assessing the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise has been limited by lack of real-time data and theoretical and statistical models. This lack may hinder efforts to promote exercise maintenance. Purpose: We test the bi-directional relationship between stress and exercise using real-time data for the average person and the variability—individual differences—in this relationship. Methods: An observational study was conducted within a single cohort randomized controlled experiment. Healthy young adults, ( n = 79) who reported only intermittent exercise, completed 12 months of stress monitoring by ecological momentary assessment (at the beginning of, end of, and during the day) and continuous activity monitoring by Fitbit. A random coefficients linear mixed model was used to predict end-of-day stress from the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise that day; a logistic mixed model was used to predict the occurrence/non-occurrence of exercise from ratings of anticipated stress. Separate regression analyses were also performed for each participant. Sensitivity analysis tested all models, restricted to the first 180 days of observation (prior to randomization). Results: We found a significant average inverse (i.e., negative) effect of exercise on stress and of stress on exercise. There was significant between-person variability. Of N = 69, exercise was associated with a stress reduction for 15, a stress increase for 2, and no change for the remainder. We also found that an increase in anticipated stress reported the previous night or that morning was associated with a significant 20–22% decrease (OR = 0.78–0.80) in the odds of exercising that day. Of N = 69, this increase in stress reduced the likelihood of exercise for 17, increased the odds for 1, and had no effect for the remainder. We were unable to identify psychosocial factors that moderate the individual differences in these effects. Conclusions: The relationship of stress to exercise can be uni- or bi-directional and varies from person to person. A precision medicine approach may improve exercise uptake.

"Burke, Lora E.; Styn, Mindi A.; Sereika, Susan M.; Conroy, Molly B.; Ye, Lei; Glanz, Karen; Sevick, Mary Ann; Ewing, Linda J.",Using mHealth technology to enhance self-monitoring for weight loss: A randomized trial,"Background: Self-monitoring for weight loss has traditionally been performed with paper diaries. Technologic advances could reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide feedback to enhance adherence. Purpose: To determine if self-monitoring diet using a PDA only or the PDA with daily tailored feedback (PDA + feedback [FB]), was superior to using a paper diary on weight loss and maintenance. Design: The Self-Monitoring and Recording Using Technology (SMART) Trial was a 24-month randomized clinical trial; participants were randomly assigned to one of three self-monitoring groups. Setting/participants: From 2006 to 2008, a total of 210 overweight/obese adults (84.8% female, 78.1% white) were recruited from the community. Data were analyzed in 2011. Intervention: Participants received standard behavioral treatment for weight loss that included dietary and physical activity goals, encouraged the use of self-monitoring, and was delivered in group sessions. Main outcome measures: Percentage weight change at 24 months, adherence to self-monitoring over time. Results: Study retention was 85.6%. The mean percentage weight loss at 24 months was not different among groups (paper diary: −1.94%, 95% CI = −3.88, 0.01; PDA: −1.38%, 95% CI= −3.38, 0.62; PDA + FB: −2.32%, 95% CI = −4.29, −0.35); only the PDA+FB group ( p = 0.02) demonstrated a significant loss. For adherence to self-monitoring, there was a time-by-treatment group interaction between the combined PDA groups and the paper diary group ( p = 0.03) but no difference between PDA and PDA+FB groups ( p = 0.49). Across all groups, weight loss was greater for those who were adherent ≥ 60% versus <30% of the time ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: PDA+FB use resulted in a small weight loss at 24 months; PDA use resulted in greater adherence to dietary self-monitoring over time. However, for sustained weight loss, adherence to self-monitoring is more important than the method used to self-monitor. A daily feedback message delivered remotely enhanced adherence and improved weight loss, which suggests that technology can play a role in improving weight loss.
